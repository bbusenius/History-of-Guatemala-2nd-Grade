## Copywork Instructions

Copywork is a key Charlotte Mason method used in this curriculum to improve handwriting and deepen engagement with historical content. Starting in Unit 1, most lessons include a short copywork activity where your child will copy a meaningful sentence from a living book or primary source related to the lesson’s theme.

### How to Facilitate Copywork
- **Preparation**: Before the lesson, ensure you have plain paper or a notebook and a pencil or crayon. The copywork sentence will be provided in the lesson plan, often with English and Spanish options to support bilingual learning.
- **Timing**: Each copywork activity takes about 5 minutes and is integrated into the Main Activity section, typically after storytelling or reading a primary source.
- **Procedure**:
  1. Present the sentence to your child (e.g., write it on paper or show it from the lesson plan).
  2. Say, “Let’s copy this neatly to remember what we learned about [topic].” For example, in Unit 2, Lesson 1: “Let’s copy this to remember the Maya.”
  3. Guide your child to write the sentence once or twice, focusing on letter formation and spacing. Encourage them to take their time.
  4. Praise their effort: “Great job writing that so carefully!”
- **Adaptation**: For younger or struggling writers, let them trace the sentence or write it once. For advanced learners, encourage writing it twice or adding a related sentence.
- **Storage**: After the lesson, place the copywork paper in your child’s portfolio (see `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`) to track progress over the 10 weeks.

### Why Copywork Matters
Copywork not only builds handwriting skills but also helps your child connect with Guatemala’s history by writing words from the past. It’s a simple, meaningful way to make learning stick!

## Dictation Exercises

Dictation is a Charlotte Mason method used to improve spelling and deepen engagement with historical and cultural content. In selected lessons, your child will write a short sentence dictated by you, taken from the lesson’s story or primary source, enhancing their connection to Guatemalan history.

### How to Facilitate Dictation
- **Preparation**: Have paper and a pencil ready; review the lesson’s dictation sentence beforehand (provided in the lesson plan).
- **Timing**: Each dictation takes 5 minutes, added to the main activity, extending some lessons to 50 minutes (within the 30-60 minute range).
- **Procedure**:
  1. Say, “Now, let’s write a sentence from our story.”
  2. Dictate the sentence slowly, word by word, repeating if needed (e.g., “The - Maya - ate - corn”).
  3. Have your child write it in their notebook or on paper.
  4. Check their writing for spelling accuracy and offer positive feedback (e.g., “You spelled ‘Maya’ perfectly!”).
- **Adaptation**: Choose English or Spanish based on preference; simplify by allowing tracing or shortening the sentence for younger learners (e.g., “Maya ate” instead of “The Maya ate corn”).
- **Purpose**: This builds spelling skills while reinforcing historical facts, like the Maya’s reliance on corn or colonial church bells.

### Examples Across Units
- **Unit 1**: “The Maya ate corn.” / “Los Mayas comían maíz.” (Lesson 2)
- **Unit 3**: “The church bells rang.” / “Las campanas sonaron.” (Lesson 2)
- **Unit 4**: “The plaza was busy.” / “La plaza estaba ocupada.” (Lesson 2)
- **Unit 5**: “Mariano helped Guatemala.” / “Mariano ayudó a Guatemala.” (Lesson 2)
- **Unit 6**: “The lights came on.” / “Las luces se encendieron.” (Lesson 1)
- **Unit 7**: “People in Guatemala go to school.” / “La gente en Guatemala va a la escuela.” (Lesson 1)

### Tips
- Practice the sentence yourself to ensure clear delivery.
- Encourage effort over perfection; praise attempts at tricky words (e.g., “You got ‘Guatemala’ close!”).
- Store dictation papers in the portfolio (see `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`) to track progress.

## Picture Study Instructions

Picture study is a Charlotte Mason method introduced in this curriculum to enrich your child’s understanding of Guatemalan history and culture through art appreciation. Starting in Unit 1, several lessons include a 5-minute picture study segment where your child observes and discusses a piece of Guatemalan art or a historical scene tied to the lesson’s theme.

### How to Facilitate Picture Study
- **Preparation**: Before the lesson, source a high-quality image as specified in the lesson plan (e.g., a colonial painting, Maya artifact). Use online museum resources like Google Arts & Culture (https://artsandculture.google.com) or Wikimedia Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org), searching terms like “Guatemala colonial painting” or “Maya artifact.” Ensure the image is free for educational use or labeled for reuse. Alternatively, draw a simple sketch if internet access is unavailable (e.g., a kite for the Giant Kite Festival).
- **Timing**: Each picture study takes 5 minutes, integrated into the Main Activity section after storytelling or related content.
- **Procedure**:
  1. Show your child the image and say, “Look at this picture quietly for 2 minutes. Notice the colors, shapes, and anything interesting.”
  2. After 2 minutes, cover the image and ask, “What did you see? What colors or shapes do you remember?” Encourage simple responses (e.g., “It’s red” or “I saw a house”).
  3. Uncover the image and discuss further: “What do you think this is? How does it connect to our story?” Use lesson-specific questions (e.g., “What buildings do you see?” for Unit 4, Lesson 1).
  4. Praise their observations: “Great job noticing the details!”
- **Adaptation**: For younger learners, shorten observation to 1 minute or focus on one detail. For advanced learners, ask deeper questions (e.g., “What does this tell us about the Maya?”).
- **Storage**: Note key observations in the portfolio (e.g., “Child noticed green in the artifact”) or include a quick sketch if desired.

### Sourcing Tips
- **Online Resources**: Prioritize free, high-resolution images from museum sites or Wikimedia Commons. Search terms are provided in each lesson (e.g., “Giant Kite Festival Sumpango Guatemala”).
- **Accessibility in Guatemala**: Internet is reliable in San Juan del Obispo; use Wi-Fi for downloads. If unavailable, check local libraries or draw a simple version (e.g., a church for Unit 8).
- **Substitutions**: If an exact image isn’t found, choose a similar one (e.g., any Maya artifact for Unit 1). Avoid modern photos unless specified; focus on historical art.

### Why Picture Study Matters
Picture study helps your child see history through art, building observation skills and cultural pride. It’s a simple, fun way to connect lessons to Guatemala’s rich past and present!

## Composer Study
To deepen your child’s connection to Guatemalan history and culture, this curriculum includes brief composer study activities in select lessons, starting with Unit 5, Lesson 1 (Road to Independence) and Unit 9, Lesson 1 (Local Festivals in San Juan del Obispo). These 5-minute segments involve listening to short pieces of Guatemalan music, such as “Chichicastenango” by Paco Pérez (Unit 5) and “Fiesta de Pájaros” by Jesús Castillo (Unit 9, performed by a quartet), followed by simple reflection questions (e.g., “Does this music sound happy?”). Aligned with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on art appreciation, the composer study helps your child explore historical and cultural themes through music, fostering emotional engagement and cultural pride. For example, Unit 5’s music reflects the joy of independence, while Unit 9’s piece evokes the lively spirit of local festivals. Additional units may include composer studies as the curriculum expands.

### Preparing for Composer Study
For lessons with a composer study (e.g., Unit 5, Lesson 1, and Unit 9, Lesson 1), you’ll need to source short musical pieces (2–3 minutes) from free online sources like YouTube or prepare an offline alternative. Here’s how to prepare:
- **Unit 5, Lesson 1 (Road to Independence)**: Find “Chichicastenango” by Paco Pérez, a marimba instrumental. Use the YouTube link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nT_5sY3mJI, by Marimba Chapinlandia, ~2:45) or search “Chichicastenango Paco Pérez marimba” for a similar version. If internet is unavailable, practice humming or singing the main melody (~1 minute, a lively, repetitive rhythm) to mimic the piece’s joyful tone.
- **Unit 9, Lesson 1 (Local Festivals in San Juan del Obispo)**: Find “Fiesta de Pájaros” by Jesús Castillo, a quartet version. Use the YouTube link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrS_d0LDlvo, by Cuarteto del Alba, ~2:45). If internet is unavailable, hum or sing the main melody (~1 minute, a bird-like, upbeat rhythm with a string-like tone) to reflect the festive mood.
- **General Tips**: Spend ~5 minutes before the lesson to save the YouTube links or test audio playback on your device (e.g., phone, tablet, or computer) to ensure clarity. Verify the pieces are engaging for a 7-year-old (e.g., avoid slow or complex versions). If your child is familiar with either piece, contact the curriculum provider for alternative suggestions. No musical expertise is required—just enthusiasm to share Guatemala’s musical heritage!

### Facilitating Composer Study
The composer study is a 5-minute activity in select lessons (e.g., Unit 5, Lesson 1, and Unit 9, Lesson 1) where your child listens to a short piece of Guatemalan music and reflects on its mood or connection to the lesson’s theme. Here’s how to facilitate it:
1. **Introduce the Piece (1 minute)**: Use the lesson plan’s introduction to set the context. For example, in Unit 5, Lesson 1, say, “Let’s listen to ‘Chichicastenango’ by Paco Pérez, a marimba song celebrating Guatemala’s heart, like the joy of becoming free in 1821!” For Unit 9, Lesson 1, say, “Let’s hear ‘Fiesta de Pájaros’ by Jesús Castillo, played by a quartet to sound like birds singing at a joyful festival in San Juan del Obispo!”
2. **Play the Music (2–3 minutes)**: Play the sourced YouTube clip (e.g., “Chichicastenango” at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nT_5sY3mJI for Unit 5, or “Fiesta de Pájaros” at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrS_d0LDlvo for Unit 9) in a quiet setting. Ensure the volume is clear but not overwhelming. If offline, hum or sing the melody as described in the preparation section.
3. **Prompt Reflection (1–2 minutes)**: After the music, ask the lesson’s reflection question, such as “Does this music sound joyful or proud?” (Unit 5) or “Does this music make you think of a festival?” (Unit 9). Encourage simple responses (e.g., “It’s happy” or “It sounds like birds”). If your child is shy, share your own reaction first (e.g., “I think it sounds like a big party!”) to spark discussion.
4. **Engage and Connect**: To make it fun, tap along to the rhythm or mimic dancing to the music with your child. For Unit 9, you might pretend to “flutter” like birds to connect to “Fiesta de Pájaros.” Note any interesting comments (e.g., “It’s like a parade!”) for the portfolio to track engagement.
This activity requires no prior musical knowledge—just follow the lesson plan’s prompts and enjoy exploring Guatemala’s music with your child!

## Narration Guidance
Narration is a key part of the Charlotte Mason method, helping your child process and retain what they’ve learned by telling it back in their own words. In this curriculum, narration prompts are provided for each unit to guide your child’s retelling during the 10-minute narration segment of every lesson. These prompts are designed to grow with your child’s abilities, moving from simple retellings to more detailed and thoughtful responses as the course progresses. This supports Charlotte Mason’s developmental approach, building confidence and skills step-by-step.

### How Narration Works in This Curriculum
- **Units 1-3: Simple Retelling** 
 - Focus: Basic recall of events or facts (e.g., “What happened in the story of the quetzal?”). 
 - Purpose: Helps your child practice putting events in order and remembering key points. 
 - Example Response : “The quetzal flew away and was free.”

- **Units 4-7: Descriptive** 
 - Focus: Adding details about settings or feelings (e.g., “What did the buildings in Antigua look like during colonial times?”). 
 - Purpose: Encourages your child to notice and describe more, growing their vocabulary and imagination. 
 - Example Response: “The buildings were tall with yellow walls and big windows.”

- **Units 8-10: Comparative** 
 - Focus: Reflecting on differences or changes (e.g., “How is San Juan del Obispo different now from when it was founded?”). 
 - Purpose: Builds critical thinking by comparing past and present or different ideas. 
 - Example Response: “It’s different now because we have cars, but long ago they walked.”

### How to Facilitate Narration
- **Before the Lesson (2-5 minutes)**: Look at the prompts for the unit in `assessment/narration_prompts.md` and pick one or two that fit the lesson (e.g., “What did a Maya child do every day?” for Unit 2, Lesson 2). Have a quiet spot ready.
- **During Narration (10 minutes)**: Ask the prompt and give your child time to think. Listen without interrupting, even if they pause. If they’re stuck, offer a hint (e.g., “What did Juan see in the plaza?”) but let them lead. Praise their effort: “I love how you told that part!”
- **After Narration (2-3 minutes)**: Write down a short note of what they said (e.g., “The Maya ate corn”) or let them draw it. Save it for the portfolio to see their progress.

### Discussing Indigenous Perspectives
This curriculum incorporates Maya perspectives to provide a balanced and culturally sensitive narrative, especially in pre-Columbian and colonial units. Stories like the *Popol Vuh* creation myth and discussion questions about the Maya’s feelings during the Spanish arrival help your child understand history from multiple viewpoints. When reading these stories or discussing topics like the Spanish conquest, encourage your child to imagine how the Maya felt by asking questions such as, “How would you feel if strangers came to our town?” or “Why was corn special to the Maya?” Explain that history changes depending on who tells it, and understanding the Maya’s side builds respect for their culture. Approach these talks with care, emphasizing the value of diverse voices and Guatemala’s indigenous heritage.

**Facilitation Tips**:
- **Preparation**: Preview the *Popol Vuh* excerpt or discussion question before the lesson (~5 minutes).
- **Engagement**: Use simple prompts to spark empathy (e.g., “Would you be excited or scared?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Note your child’s responses in the portfolio to track their growing awareness (e.g., “Child said the Maya might have been surprised”).

### Tips for Success
- **Start Easy**: In early units, keep it simple—focus on one or two things they remember.
- **Encourage Details**: As you move to Units 4-7, ask “What else?” to get more description.
- **Build Connections**: In Units 8-10, help them compare by asking “How’s that like today?” or “What’s different?”
- **Be Positive**: Cheer them on, even if it’s short. Confidence grows with practice!
- **Mix It Up**: If talking is hard, let them draw or point to something (e.g., a map) to show what they mean.

### Examples Across Units
- **Unit 1**: “What happened in the story of the quetzal?” 
 - Example: “The bird flew high and didn’t get caught.”
- **Unit 4**: “What did the buildings in Antigua look like during colonial times?” 
 - Example: “They were big with red roofs and white walls.”
- **Unit 8**: “How is San Juan del Obispo different now from when it was founded?” 
 - Example: “Now we have a school, but back then it was just a church.”

By following this progression, your child will build narration skills—from simple stories to rich reflections—while connecting deeply with Guatemala’s history and their own community.
