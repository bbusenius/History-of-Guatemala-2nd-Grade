# Field Trip Plan: Unit 9 - Visit to Museo San Juan del Obispo (Bishop's Palace)

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. Following Unit 9's lessons on the local history of San Juan del Obispo, this visit to the Palacio del Obispo (Bishop's Palace) brings the town's history to life. Built in the 1530s-1540s by Bishop Francisco Marroquín, the founder of San Juan del Obispo, this historic building now serves as a museum that showcases colonial architecture and life. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired approaches of firsthand observation and narration, this 1-2 hour visit allows the student to see and experience the historical spaces they've been learning about in their lessons, creating a tangible connection to local history.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason's philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Deepening historical understanding through firsthand observation of colonial architecture and living spaces.
- Encouraging narrative skills through guided observation and post-trip reflection, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Developing visual literacy by examining historical artifacts, architecture, and artwork in their original context.
- Creating meaningful connections between classroom learning and tangible historical sites in the student's own community.
- Promoting cultural appreciation by exploring a significant heritage site that reflects Guatemala's colonial history.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify key architectural features of the Bishop's Palace and explain their historical significance.
2. Describe how Bishop Francisco Marroquín contributed to the founding of San Juan del Obispo.
3. Compare and contrast daily life in colonial times with modern life through observation of the palace's living quarters.
4. Recognize symbols and motifs in the palace (such as coats of arms and decorative elements) and explain their meaning.
5. Narrate what they learned about the palace and its history in their own words.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Complete the palace scavenger hunt and create a detailed drawing of an architectural feature.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement during the guided tour; listen for questions and comments that demonstrate understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**: Review the student's drawing and scavenger hunt list; have them narrate what they learned about the palace's history and Bishop Marroquín's role in founding San Juan del Obispo.

## Differentiation Strategies
