# Field Trip Plan: Unit 9 - Local Market Visit

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on local history and culture by visiting a market in Antigua or San Juan del Obispo, connecting Lessons 1 and 2 to real-world experiences. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration, this optional 2-3 hour trip leverages the student’s residence in San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing cultural understanding through observation of local markets and traditions.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussions, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to the student’s local community.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Observe items and activities at a local market (e.g., foods, crafts).
2. Connect the market visit to Lessons 1-2 about festivals and community life.
3. Sketch one market item or scene to demonstrate engagement.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing and shoes, transportation to the market (~15-30 minutes if in Antigua).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos (to aid narration).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; markets are typically free; transportation costs vary (e.g., bus ~$1-$2).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for an educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “We’re visiting a market to see what people buy and sell in our community!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a bag.
     - Choose a market (e.g., Mercado de Antigua) and plan transportation.
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the market.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive; say, “Look at all the colors and smells!”
     - Set goal: “Let’s find something interesting to draw.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Observe and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Walk through stalls, noting items (e.g., fruits, textiles).
     - Ask, “What do you think this is used for?” or “Does this remind you of the festival?”
     - Sketch one item or scene (e.g., a fruit stand) in 15-20 minutes.
     - Explore freely if time permits.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review sketch: “What did you draw?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn about our community?” and depart.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one market item or scene in 15-20 minutes, noting its use or connection to lessons.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to reflections (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect sketch for portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess connections informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple items or add notes (e.g., “This is for festivals”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw simple shapes (e.g., a fruit); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to items while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos for detail focus.
