# Unit 9, Lesson 1: Introduction to San Juan del Obispo's History

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to the history of their hometown, San Juan del Obispo, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through reading excerpts from historical accounts, picture study of a colonial scene, a dictation exercise, and mapping, the student learns about the town's founding by Bishop Francisco Marroquín. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living stories, and hands-on activities—it fosters a sense of place and heritage, leveraging the student's proximity to Antigua, Guatemala, and building on prior units' colonial context.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses historical accounts from "Francisco Marroquín: The History of San Juan del Obispo and the Early Capitals of Guatemala" to bring local history to life through factual narratives.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits reading and picture study to concise segments (e.g., 5-minute picture study) for focus.
- **Picture Study**: Adds a 5-minute segment with a colonial painting to foster observation and cultural context, aligning with Charlotte Mason's art appreciation approach.
- **Hands-On**: Includes mapping to engage kinesthetic learning with historical geography.
- **Dictation**: Incorporates a dictation exercise to practice spelling and connect to historical content, per Charlotte Mason's method.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand that San Juan del Obispo was founded by Bishop Francisco Marroquín in colonial times.
2. Observe and narrate features of the 100 Quetzal bill featuring Francisco Marroquín's portrait (e.g., details of the portrait).
3. Write a dictated sentence about the town's founding with correct spelling.
4. Retell key facts about Francisco Marroquín and San Juan del Obispo in their own words.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the student and introduce local history.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Today, we’ll learn about our town, San Juan del Obispo, and how it started long ago!”
     - Ask, “Do you know who built the big church we see?” to spark curiosity.
     - Recap briefly: “This happened after the Spanish came.”
2. **Main Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the town's history through reading, picture study, and dictation.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Reading (15 minutes)**: Read [Francisco Marroquín: The History of San Juan del Obispo and the Early Capitals of Guatemala](resources/san_juan_del_obispo_history.md) aloud. Show optional images if available. Pause to ask, “What did Bishop Marroquín do for our town?”
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the [image of the 100 Quetzal bill featuring Francisco Marroquín's portrait](https://en.numista.com/catalogue/photos/guatemala/6239a7efac1600.56041434-original.jpg). Say, "Look at this picture for 2 minutes. Notice who is on this money and what details you can see." After 2 minutes, cover it and ask, "What did you see on the bill? What did Francisco Marroquín look like?" Then, uncover and discuss: "Why do you think Francisco Marroquín is on Guatemala's money? What does this tell us about how important he was?”
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence about who started our town.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "Bishop Marroquín built a palace in San Juan del Obispo in 1547." (English) or "El obispo Marroquín construyó un palacio en San Juan del Obispo en 1547." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “You wrote ‘palace’ great!”).
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the story” or “What’s on your picture?”
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., “Bishop built the palace”). Note a key phrase (e.g., “San Juan has a big church”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “San Juan del Obispo began with Bishop Marroquín, and it’s our home!”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn more about the church we see every day!”
     - Add a church drawing to the timeline’s Local History section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Reading**: Listen to excerpts from [Francisco Marroquín: The History of San Juan del Obispo and the Early Capitals of Guatemala](resources/san_juan_del_obispo_history.md) to learn about the town’s founding (15 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss the 100 Quetzal bill featuring Francisco Marroquín to appreciate his historical importance (5 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to the story (5 minutes).

- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Reading**: Listen for narration details (e.g., bishop, palace) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., "I saw Francisco Marroquín on the money") for memory and detail.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “palace” or “construyó”).

- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical understanding informally based on effort and accuracy.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 9 connection, focusing on creativity and relevance (no formal rubric; based on engagement).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate additional story details (e.g., "He helped people"); write an extra dictation sentence about Marroquín's work with indigenous languages.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to "Who built the palace?"; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out being a bishop or building a palace; hold the currency image while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional images or emphasize the picture study to reinforce concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 25 minutes (15 min reading, 5 min picture study, 5 min dictation)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, coloring, and writing skills; familiarity with colonial history from Units 3-4.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, source an online image, and assist with map labeling; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the historical text and source the 100 Quetzal bill image (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the historical text, present the picture study, dictate the sentence, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What’s your favorite part of our town?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student's sketch of Francisco Marroquín or his palace.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the historical text and currency image; describe visuals aloud (e.g., "The bill shows Marroquín with a beard").
- **Motor Needs**: Use a pencil grip for dictation; provide tracing paper if needed.
- **Attention Needs**: Break the lesson into shorter segments; add movement breaks between activities (e.g., "Let's stretch before we write!").
- **Language Needs**: Simplify instructions; provide a bilingual version of the story; use visual cues alongside verbal instructions.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to a device for viewing the historical text and currency image if not printed.
- Assumes 45 minutes of focused time; can be split into two sessions (reading/picture study and dictation) if needed.
- Assumes basic familiarity with the town of San Juan del Obispo, as the student lives there.
- Relies on prior colonial units; recap Spanish arrival briefly (“The Spanish came long ago”) if needed.
