# Unit 9, Lesson 1: Introduction to San Juan del Obispo's History

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to the history of their hometown, San Juan del Obispo, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through storytelling with "The Bishop's Town," picture study of a colonial scene, a dictation exercise, and mapping, the student learns about the town’s founding by Bishop Francisco Marroquín. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living stories, and hands-on activities—it fosters a sense of place and heritage, leveraging the student’s proximity to Antigua, Guatemala, and building on prior units’ colonial context.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses "The Bishop's Town" as a narrative-driven story to bring local history to life, per Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on engaging texts.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling and picture study to concise segments (e.g., 5-minute picture study) for focus.
- **Picture Study**: Adds a 5-minute segment with a colonial painting to foster observation and cultural context, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s art appreciation approach.
- **Hands-On**: Includes mapping to engage kinesthetic learning with historical geography.
- **Dictation**: Incorporates a dictation exercise to practice spelling and connect to historical content, per Charlotte Mason’s method.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand that San Juan del Obispo was founded by Bishop Francisco Marroquín in colonial times.
2. Locate key features of San Juan del Obispo on a map (e.g., church, school).
3. Observe and narrate features of a colonial painting (e.g., colors, buildings).
4. Write a dictated sentence about the town’s founding with correct spelling.
5. Retell elements of "The Bishop's Town" in their own words.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "The Bishop's Town" (from `units/unit8/resources/the_bishops_town.md`; print or read from a device).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the student and introduce local history.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Today, we’ll learn about our town, San Juan del Obispo, and how it started long ago!”
     - Ask, “Do you know who built the big church we see?” to spark curiosity.
     - Recap briefly: “This happened after the Spanish came.”
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the town’s history through storytelling, picture study, dictation, and mapping.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "The Bishop's Town" aloud with expression. Show optional images if available. Pause to ask, “What did Bishop Marroquín do for our town?”
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the colonial painting image. Say, “Look at this picture for 2 minutes. Notice the buildings and colors.” After 2 minutes, cover it and ask, “What did you see? What colors or shapes stood out?” Then, uncover and discuss: “Does this look like our town? What buildings do you see?”
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence about who started our town.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "Bishop Marroquín built a church in San Juan del Obispo." (English) or "El obispo Marroquín construyó una iglesia en San Juan del Obispo." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “You wrote ‘church’ great!”).
     - **Mapping (10 minutes)**: Provide the map and crayons. Guide the student to color and label key features (e.g., church in yellow, hills green). Say, “Let’s find where we live on this map!”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the story” or “What’s on your map or in the picture?”
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., “Bishop built the church”). Note a key phrase (e.g., “San Juan has a big church”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “San Juan del Obispo began with Bishop Marroquín, and it’s our home!”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn more about the church we see every day!”
     - Add a church drawing to the timeline’s Local History section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "The Bishop's Town" to learn about the town’s founding (10 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss a colonial painting to appreciate historical context (5 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to the story (5 minutes).
  - **Mapping**: Color and label a map of San Juan del Obispo to explore geography (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen for narration details (e.g., bishop, church) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “I saw a white building”) for memory and detail.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “built” or “construyó”).
  - **Mapping**: Observe accuracy in coloring/labeling (e.g., church location) to gauge engagement and spatial awareness.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and map for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical understanding informally based on effort and accuracy.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 8 connection, focusing on creativity and relevance (no formal rubric; based on engagement).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label extra map features (e.g., “Our Home”) or narrate additional story details (e.g., “He helped people”); write an extra dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-label the map with stickers; simplify narration to “Who built the church?”; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to map locations or hold the painting image while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional images or emphasize the picture study to reinforce concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min storytelling, 5 min picture study, 5 min dictation, 10 min mapping)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include picture study without reducing other activities)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, coloring, and writing skills; familiarity with colonial history from Units 3-4.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, source an online image, and assist with map labeling; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Prepare the map as per `units/unit8/resources/san_juan_map.md`, print or load the story, and source the painting image online (~10-15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the story, present the picture study, dictate the sentence, guide mapping, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What’s your favorite part of our town?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and map in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student’s sketch.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map, story text, and painting image; describe visuals aloud (e.g., “The painting has green hills”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label the map or assist with coloring; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Attention Span**: Split storytelling and mapping into two 12-minute segments with a movement break.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “obispo/bishop”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes ability to draw or source a simple map; a basic hand-drawn sketch works if no printer available.
- Assumes internet access for the painting image; an offline alternative is a parent-drawn sketch of a colonial town if unavailable.
- Assumes student lives in San Juan del Obispo; adapt for other locations by emphasizing proximity to Antigua.
- Relies on prior colonial units; recap Spanish arrival briefly (“The Spanish came long ago”) if needed.
