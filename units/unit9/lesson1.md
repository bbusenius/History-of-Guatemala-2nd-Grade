Lesson Plan: Unit 9, Lesson 1 - Local Festivals in San Juan del Obispo

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to local festivals in San Juan del Obispo, focusing on the feast of San Juan Bautista as an example of cultural traditions within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through storytelling with "The Festival of San Juan," a composer study featuring traditional festival music, and a hands-on flag craft, the student will explore the significance of festivals in community life. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living stories, and hands-on activities—it fosters cultural appreciation and connects traditions to the student’s heritage near Antigua, building on Unit 8’s local history foundation and enriching understanding through music.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses "The Festival of San Juan" as a narrative-driven story to vividly portray local traditions, adhering to Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on engaging, authentic texts.
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling to enhance comprehension and memory, promoting active participation in learning.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling to 10 minutes and composer study to 5 minutes to maintain focus appropriate for a young learner.
- **Composer Study**: Incorporates a 5-minute listening segment with traditional marimba music to deepen cultural and historical understanding through auditory arts, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s holistic integration of music appreciation.
- **Hands-On**: Includes a flag craft to engage kinesthetic learning, making festival concepts tangible and memorable.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe the significance of the feast of San Juan Bautista in San Juan del Obispo (e.g., honoring the patron saint, community celebration).
2. Reflect on a piece of traditional festival music and describe its mood or connection to the event.
3. Create a paper flag to represent festival decorations.
4. Retell elements of "The Festival of San Juan" in their own words.

## Materials and Resources Required

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce local festivals and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 8: “We learned about our town’s history. Now, we’ll see how we celebrate today!”
     - Say, “Our town has special days called festivals, like the feast of San Juan. We’ll hear a story, listen to music, and make a festival flag!”
     - Ask, “Have you seen decorations or parades in our town?” to spark discussion (e.g., “Yes, with flags!”).
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the festival through storytelling, composer study, and crafting.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "The Festival of San Juan" aloud with enthusiasm. Show optional images of festival decorations or processions to enhance visuals. Pause midway to ask, “Why do you think they have festivals?” (Expect answers like “To have fun” or “To celebrate San Juan”).
    - **Composer Study (5 minutes)**:
      - **Objective**: Experience traditional festival music and connect it to the celebration through a quartet arrangement.
      - **Procedure**:
        - Say, “Let’s hear ‘Fiesta de Pájaros’ by Jesús Castillo, played by a quartet to sound like birds singing at a joyful festival in San Juan del Obispo!”
        - Play the 2:45 quartet version of “Fiesta de Pájaros” (sourced from YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrS_d0LDlvo, performed by Cuarteto del Alba). Ensure a calm setting and clear audio.
        - After listening, ask, “Does this music make you think of a festival? Can you imagine birds or people dancing to it?” (Expect responses like “It’s lively” or “It sounds like a party”).
     - **Crafting (15 minutes)**: Provide construction paper, scissors, glue, and markers. Guide the student: “Cut a flag shape—like a triangle or rectangle—from the paper. Decorate it with colors or drawings like you’d see at a festival.” Help cut if needed, then say, “Add a picture or message, like ‘San Juan!’ This is for our own festival!” Encourage creativity inspired by the story or music (e.g., “Use bright colors like the marimba sounds”).
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through oral retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the festival in the story” or “What’s on your flag and why?”
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., “They danced for San Juan” or “My flag has flowers”). Note a key idea for the portfolio (e.g., “The festival is for San Juan”).
     - Offer prompts if needed (e.g., “What did Maria do?” or “What did the music sound like?”).
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize the lesson and preview the next one.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Festivals like San Juan’s bring our town together with music and fun!”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn about daily life in San Juan del Obispo!”
     - Optionally, add a flag sketch or craft representation to the timeline’s Local History section with the student, saying, “This shows our festival!”

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Listening to "The Festival of San Juan" to understand local traditions and community celebration.
  - **Composer Study (5 minutes)**: Listening to a marimba piece to experience the auditory culture of Guatemalan festivals.
  - **Crafting (15 minutes)**: Making a paper flag to engage with festival decorations and symbolize participation in the tradition.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen for narration details (e.g., “They had a procession” or “They ate tamales”) to assess comprehension of the festival’s purpose and activities.
  - **Composer Study**: Note responses to the music (e.g., “It’s loud and fun”) to evaluate emotional engagement and connection to the festive atmosphere.
  - **Crafting**: Observe the flag’s design (e.g., includes colors or symbols from the story) and ask, “What’s your flag for?” to gauge understanding and creativity.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the paper flag for the portfolio, assessing participation and cultural connection informally based on effort and relevance (e.g., reflects festival themes like celebration or community).
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 9 connection, focusing on creativity and link to local traditions (no formal rubric; based on engagement and effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage adding a written message to the flag (e.g., “Viva San Juan!”) or narrating additional festival details (e.g., “They played marimbas all night”); include intricate designs inspired by the music.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut the flag shape to simplify the task; shorten narration prompt to “What’s the festival for?” (e.g., “San Juan”); focus on coloring rather than detailed drawing.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Wave the flag like a parade banner while narrating or mimic dancing to the music to involve movement.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional festival images to inspire flag decoration (e.g., “Add flowers like these!”); emphasize the marimba’s lively rhythm to visualize a party scene.
- **Auditory Learners**: Replay a short music segment or hum along during crafting; encourage sound descriptions in narration (e.g., “The music was fast”).

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min storytelling, 5 min composer study, 15 min crafting)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (within the adjustable 30-60 minute range specified in the original course request)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting and drawing skills (e.g., can use scissors with adult help and color within lines); familiarity with San Juan del Obispo’s history from Unit 8, Lesson 1 to contextualize community traditions.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud with expression, play a short audio clip, and assist with crafting; no historical or musical expertise required, as instructions and resources are provided.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load "The Festival of San Juan" on a device (~5 minutes); find a suitable marimba piece on YouTube (~5 minutes); gather craft supplies including construction paper, scissors, glue, and markers (~5-10 minutes total).
- **Facilitation**: Read the story aloud with enthusiasm, play the marimba piece clearly, assist with cutting the flag shape and decorating, and prompt narration with provided questions to guide reflection.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by participating in the discussion (e.g., “What would you celebrate in a festival?”) or tapping along to the music to make it interactive and fun.
- **Follow-Up**: Store the completed flag in the portfolio (e.g., a binder or folder); optionally update the timeline with the student’s flag or a sketch, praising their creativity (e.g., “Your flag looks so festive!”).

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the story text (e.g., increase font size on a device or print larger); describe optional images aloud (e.g., “This shows colorful flags”); use high-contrast markers for flag visibility (e.g., bright red on white paper).
- **Auditory Needs**: Play music at a clear volume and repeat key story phrases (e.g., “They carried San Juan”); allow extra time for narration responses; provide a quiet space for listening to avoid distractions.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut the flag shape or assist with cutting and gluing; simplify decoration to coloring with large markers; use a larger paper size (e.g., 11x17) for easier handling if needed.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes by summarizing parts (e.g., skip repetitive details) or crafting to 10 minutes with a 2-minute stretch break between activities; keep music brief (e.g., 2 minutes).
- **Language Support**: Present the story and questions in both English and Spanish if preferred (e.g., “¿Por qué tienen festivales?”); use bilingual terms during crafting (e.g., “bandera/flag,” “festival/festival”); allow narration in the student’s stronger language for ease and confidence.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic craft supplies in the household; if construction paper or markers are unavailable, plain paper and pencils can substitute, though the festive effect may be less vibrant.
- Assumes internet access to source the marimba piece; if unavailable, the parent can hum a simple tune or clap a rhythm as an offline alternative, though it lacks the authentic marimba sound.
- Assumes a printer or device for the story; if neither is accessible, the parent can retell the story orally from memory after reviewing it, maintaining the narrative focus.
- Relies on Unit 8’s historical context for San Juan del Obispo; if missed, briefly recap during the introduction (e.g., “Our town started long ago with a church”).
- Assumes a quiet environment for music listening; if noise is an issue, use headphones or adjust timing to a calmer period.
