# A Day in San Juan del Obispo

Juan lives in San Juan del Obispo with his family. Every morning, he wakes up to the sound of roosters and the smell of fresh bread from the bakery down the street. After breakfast of eggs and beans, he walks to school with his friends, passing by the big church and the plaza where people sell fruits and vegetables.

At school, Juan learns reading, writing, and about Guatemala’s history. His favorite subject is art, where he draws pictures of his town. After school, he helps his father in the garden, where they grow tomatoes and flowers. Sometimes, he plays soccer with his friends in the plaza.

In the evening, Juan’s family gathers for dinner, and his grandmother tells stories about when she was young. She talks about how the town has changed but still keeps its traditions. Juan loves living in San Juan del Obispo, where everyone knows each other and there’s always something interesting happening.
