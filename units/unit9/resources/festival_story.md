# The Festival of San Juan

Once a year, in the town of San Juan del Obispo, everyone gets ready for a big party. It’s the feast day of San Juan Bautista, the town’s patron saint. The streets are decorated with colorful flags and flowers. People clean their houses and prepare special foods like tamales and atole.

On the day of the festival, there is a procession where people carry a statue of San Juan through the streets. There is music from marimbas and dancing. Children play games like piñata and win prizes.

In the evening, there are fireworks that light up the sky with bright colors. Maria, a girl who lives in San Juan del Obispo, loves the festival. She helps her mother make tamales and wears a beautiful dress for the procession.

The festival brings everyone together, and Maria feels proud of her town and its traditions.
