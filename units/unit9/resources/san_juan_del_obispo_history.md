# Francisco Marroquín: The History of San Juan del Obispo and the Early Capitals of Guatemala

## Background

San Juan del Obispo, originally known as **San Juan Bautista de Guatemala**, was a village near Santiago de Guatemala, the colonial capital. It was one of the locations connected with early Christian religious activities in the region (Marroquín, 1964, p. 140).

## A Fateful Meeting: Francisco Marroquín's Journey to Guatemala

Francisco Marroquín's journey to Guatemala started with an important meeting. In 1528, he met Pedro de Alvarado at the royal court in Spain. Pedro de Alvarado was the man who conquered Guatemala. At that time, Pedro was getting married to his first wife, doña Francisca de la Cueva (Marroquín, 1963, p. XIX).

A writer from that time said something interesting about this meeting. He wrote that it seemed like God planned for them to meet. Pedro de Alvarado had caused many problems in Guatemala. But maybe the one good thing he brought was his friend Marroquín, who could help fix those problems (Marroquín, 1963, p. XIX-XX).

After meeting Pedro, Marroquín sailed across the ocean to the New World. He arrived in Guatemala's capital city, Santiago de los Caballeros (now known as Ciudad Vieja), in the first days of April 1530. Marroquín was about fifty years old when he came. (Marroquín, 1963, p. XX).

On June 3, 1530, Pedro de Alvarado brought Marroquín to meet the city leaders. The city needed someone who was educated and could be a priest. This person would give the sacraments, preach, and help convert the native people to Christianity (Marroquín, 1963, p. XX).

## Marroquín's Actions as Bishop

Francisco Marroquín became the first bishop of Guatemala. He participated in efforts related to the status and rights of Indigenous people:

  - Marroquín wrote that he had advocated for the freedom of enslaved Indigenous people, stating: "I was the first to claim freedom for the slaves... the freedom allowing the Indians to live wherever they wished was directed to me; for all this... I have been the advocate" (Marroquín, 1964, pp. 273–274).
  - Marroquín was involved in the drafting of Pedro de Alvarado’s will, in which it was stated: “I declare all the Indian slaves living on the milpa farm [and their wives and children] free, and that the land where these Indian slaves currently live shall remain theirs, and I command they not be removed from it” (Marroquín, 1963, Introducción, pp. XXIX–XXX).

## The Disaster in the Capital and the Move to the Valley of Panchoy

The original colonial capital of Guatemala was established in the valley of Almolonga at the foot of Volcán de Agua (present-day Ciudad Vieja). This is where Francisco Marroquín first went with Pedro de Alvarado when he arrived in Guatemala in 1530. In September 1541, a catastrophic disaster struck the city. According to Bishop Marroquín's own testimony in his correspondence:

"It rained from Thursday afternoon, September 8, 1541, until noon on the following Sunday; from which descended such a great tempest from the volcano or mountain, two hours after nightfall on Saturday, causing damage that, to bring to memory in order to write about it, causes me new distress."
> Llovió desde un jueves en la tarde, que se contaron 8 de septiembre 1541, hasta el domingo siguiente a medio día; de lo que descendió tan gran tempestad del volcán o montaña, a dos horas después de anochecido, sábado, que hizo el daño, que pensar de traer a la memoria para escribir, me es causa de nueva turbación" (Marroquín, 1963, p. 55).

The devastation was immense, as Marroquín described in vivid detail: "The house of Adelantado [Pedro de Alvarado], which was the most sublime, has been the most cast down; as it stood in the plaza, which is the part where most of the storm surged."
> La casa del Adelantado, que fue la más sublime, ha sido la más abatida; como estuviese en la plaza, que es la parte donde la mayor parte de la tormenta acudió" (Marroquín, 1963, p. 55).

Marroquín further detailed the destruction: "The city is so filled with earth, fallen houses, stone and wood that came from the volcano that it is unrecognizable; and the people are so distressed that with every cloud they flee to the countryside."
> Está la ciudad tan ocupada de tierra, casas caídas, piedra y madera, de la que vino del volcán, que no se conoce; y las gentes están tan alborotadas, que con cada nublado se salen al campo" (Marroquín, 1963, p. 57).

In the aftermath, "Bishop Marroquín took charge of the government, together with the licentiate de la Cueva, temporarily; and upon them fell the responsibility for the relocation of the city of Guatemala to the Panchoy Valley, which was decided according to the opinion of the crown engineer, Juan Bautista Antonelli."
> "El obispo Marroquín se hizo cargo de la gobernación, junto con el licenciado de la Cueva, temporalmente; y sobre ellos recayó la responsabilidad del traslado de la ciudad de Guatemala al valle de Panchoy, la cual se decidió por el parecer del ingeniero de la corona, Juan Bautista Antonelli" (Marroquín, 1963, p. XXVI).

Marroquín was instrumental in rebuilding not just the physical city but also its social and religious institutions. He "helped with the settlement of this new city of Guatemala, because of the flooding and destruction caused by the volcano to the old City." 
> [Él] ayudó a la poblazón de esta nueva ciudad de Goatemala, por causa de la inundación y destrucción que hizo el volcán de la Ciudad antigua" (Marroquín, 1963, p. 85).

The new location of Santiago de Guatemala, in the Valley of Panchoy (today known as Antigua Guatemala) became the center of colonial activity and remained the capital for over two centuries until another series of earthquakes prompted a second relocation to the current site of Guatemala City.

## Marroquín's Palace and Linguistic Work

Marroquín was also very interested in learning the languages of the native people. He worked hard to learn K'iche' and Kaqchikel, two of the most widely spoken Mayan languages. He even wrote the first catechism (religious teaching book) in the K'iche' language. Later, this same book was published in the Kaqchikel language too. This made him the first linguist (language expert) in Guatemala (Kwei, 2022).

By learning these languages, Marroquín could talk directly with the native people and teach them about Christianity in their own languages. This approach showed his deep respect for the native cultures and made his teaching more effective.

## San Juan Bautista de Guatemala

At that time, this place was called **San Juan Bautista de Guatemala**. Today we know it as San Juan del Obispo. This place was very important in Guatemala's early church history. It became one of the first places where Bishop Francisco Marroquín became close friends with the native people who lived there. 

Marroquín didn't move to San Juan Bautista right away in 1530. Instead, the records show that he did church work with the native people in this area after he became the priest of Santiago de Guatemala in 1530.

Marroquín worked hard to help the people in this area. He got land in the valley near Santiago. He used this land to help people, especially the native people who lived there. In 1539, he asked the city leaders for more land. He wanted this land to help "los indígenas de la milpa que adquirió del Deán Godínez" (the native people of the farm he got from Dean Godínez). This shows how he tried to help and empower the native community around San Juan Bautista de Guatemala (Marroquín, 1963, Introducción, pp. 77-78).

This place was also important because it was where Spanish priests first taught native people about Christianity. Marroquín's work here helped start later church projects. These included building schools and teaching more people about Christianity throughout the area in the 1500s (Marroquín, 1963, Introducción, pp. IX-XI).

In 1547, Bishop Marroquín finished constructing a church and episcopal palace in the village. This location gave the bishop an excellent view over the entire Valley of Panchoy and the new City of Santiago de Guatemala, which was under construction at the time. This palace became his residence for many years and was the first archbishop's palace in Guatemala (Annis, 1968, p. 227; García, 2019).

## Final Days in San Juan del Obispo

Francisco Marroquín spent his final days in his palace in San Juan Bautista de Guatemala (San Juan del Obispo). In March 1563, while staying at his residence, the bishop became ill. On April 5th, he made his will before being carried by a sedan chair back to the city of Santiago de Guatemala. He died there on April 18, 1563, and was buried in the Cathedral on April 20, 1563 (Annis, 1968, p. 227).

## Conclusion

Francisco Marroquín served as Guatemala's first bishop from 1530 until his death in 1563. During his time in Guatemala, he advocated for the freedom of enslaved Indigenous people and helped establish important institutions. He founded the Hospital Real de Santiago in 1541 and the first cathedral in 1543 (Kwei, 2022). 

Marroquín played a key role in the government after the 1541 disaster, helping to relocate the capital to the Valley of Panchoy. He learned K'iche' and Kaqchikel languages and created the first religious books in these indigenous languages. In 1547, he built the first archbishop's palace in San Juan del Obispo, where he lived and worked closely with native communities.

When Marroquín died, he left his wealth to establish the Colegio de Santo Tomás, which later became the University of San Carlos de Guatemala (Kwei, 2022). His work in Guatemala lasted over 30 years and had a lasting impact on the country's religious, educational, and social development.
