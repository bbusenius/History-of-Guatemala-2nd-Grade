## The History of Níspero in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala

### Where Níspero Comes From

Níspero, also called loquat, is a fruit tree with the scientific name *Eriobotrya japonica*. This tree is not native to Guatemala. It first grew in the mountains of southeastern China and later spread to Japan and other countries. Today, the níspero tree is used in many countries as an ornamental tree ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 36](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf)).

### How Níspero Arrived in San Juan del Obispo

It is believed that níspero was introduced to San Juan del Obispo about 100 years ago. According to oral history, the Baeza family (who at the time owned more than half the land in the village and were well connected socially and economically)often hosted gatherings with both national and international guests. On one occasion, a family from Hungary visited and brought Japanese loquat (níspero japonés) fruit as a dessert. After the gathering, the Baeza family collected the seeds, started a nursery, and later transplanted the young trees. Some of those first trees still exist today ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 23-24](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf).

At first, only the Baeza family had the fruit and they guarded it closely. However, birds and other natural means helped spread the seeds to other areas. As níspero became more common, people began selling the fruit, carrying baskets weighing 30 to 40 pounds all the way to Guatemala City—sometimes walking up to 50 kilometers with the basket on their heads, and returning with daily goods ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 23-24](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf).

### From Family Gardens to a Community Crop

For many years, níspero was mostly grown in home gardens. In the early 2000s, people in San Juan del Obispo saw that níspero could be important for the whole community, not just for families. In 2003, with some help from some Belgian agronomists (agricultural scientists), they started a cooperative called COOINCOM, R.L. This group helped farmers work together to grow, harvest, and sell níspero. With the cooperative, they learned better ways to care for the trees and improve the fruit ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 16–17](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf); [Revista LS3, p. 318](https://ls3.usac.edu.gt/revindex/articulos/editor5-r138_pi313_pfi327_ra75213.pdf)).

That same year, the cooperative helped the community export níspero for the first time. This meant the fruit was sent to other countries, and the farmers earned more money for their work ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 17](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf)).

### Learning About Níspero

Scientists from the Universidad de San Carlos studied the níspero trees in San Juan del Obispo. They found many different types, or cultivars, of níspero in the village. Some of the most common are ‘Algerie’ and ‘Tanaka’. The researchers also taught farmers how to care for the trees and protect them from pests ([Ramos Estrada, 2009, p. 53–64](http://biblioteca.usac.edu.gt/tesis/01/01_2473.pdf)).

### Níspero Today

Today, níspero is an important part of life in San Juan del Obispo. The fruit is eaten fresh and used to make things like níspero wine and preserves. The cooperative continues to help farmers, and the story of níspero is celebrated in local festivals. The knowledge and trees first brought to the Baeza family have now spread to many families, making níspero a symbol of the community’s hard work and entrepreneurial spirit.
