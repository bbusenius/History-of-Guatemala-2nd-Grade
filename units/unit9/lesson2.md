# Lesson Plan: Unit 9, Lesson 2 - Community Life in San Juan del Obispo

## Overview
This lesson explores daily life in San Juan del Obispo, helping the student understand their community’s culture and traditions. Through storytelling and a drawing activity, the student will connect with local life and reflect on their own experiences. Designed for a 7-year-old, it aligns with Charlotte Mason’s methods by using narration and hands-on engagement to foster cultural appreciation and historical understanding.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The lesson supports educational goals by:
- Encouraging cultural understanding through exploration of daily routines and community life.
- Enhancing narrative skills via oral retelling, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Integrating art with cultural studies through drawing, supporting cross-subject goals (art).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe at least two aspects of daily life in San Juan del Obispo (e.g., school, family activities).
2. Draw a scene from the community to reflect on local life.
3. Retell elements of "A Day in San Juan del Obispo" in their own words.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "A Day in San Juan del Obispo" (from `units/unit9/resources/community_story.md`; print or read from a device).
- **Drawing Supplies**: Paper (standard 8.5x11), crayons or markers (household or ~$2-$5).

- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; printer or device for story; drawing supplies are household items.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:

     - Ask, “What do you do every day? Do you think kids long ago did the same things?”
2. **Main Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore daily life through story and art.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "A Day in San Juan del Obispo" aloud. Discuss similarities (e.g., “Juan goes to school like you!”) and differences (e.g., “He helps in the garden”).
     - **Drawing (15 minutes)**: Provide paper and crayons. Say, “Draw your favorite place in our town or something you do every day.” Encourage including one detail from the story (e.g., plaza).
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about Juan’s day” or “What’s in your drawing?”
     - Listen for details (e.g., school, garden) and note a key comparison for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "A Day in San Juan del Obispo" to understand community life (10 minutes).
  - **Drawing**: Create a scene of local life to reflect on the community (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Check narration for details (e.g., school, family) to gauge comprehension.
  - **Drawing**: Observe inclusion of community elements to assess engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the drawing for the portfolio, evaluating participation and cultural connection informally.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 9 connection.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Draw a detailed scene with labels or narrate more differences (e.g., “They play soccer”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify drawing to one item (e.g., house) and narration to “What does Juan do?”
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out parts of Juan’s day (e.g., walking to school).
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional images to inspire drawing.
