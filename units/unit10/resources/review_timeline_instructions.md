# Review Timeline Instructions

## Overview
This resource provides guidance for reviewing and preparing the visual timeline for the final project presentation in Unit 10 of the Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum. Designed for a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, it supports Lesson 1’s review activities and Lesson 2’s presentation. The timeline, built weekly across the course, is a key tool for synthesizing Guatemalan history from pre-Columbian times to the present, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on visual and narrative learning.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards as specified in the course rules. The resource supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through timeline review, aligning with homeschool history objectives.
- Enhancing language development via narration preparation, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Supporting informal assessment through the final project, suitable for a young learner.

## Learning Objectives
By using this resource, the student will be able to:
1. Review key historical events added to the timeline from Units 1-9.
2. Prepare a simple narrative for presenting the timeline in Lesson 2.
3. Organize their thoughts visually and verbally for the final project.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Visual Timeline**: The completed timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`, updated weekly across Units 1-9.
- **Portfolio**: Collection of crafts, maps, and narrations from Units 1-9, stored as per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
- **Optional**: Markers or crayons (household items or ~$2-$5) to enhance timeline visuals if needed.
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for narration tips (provided in curriculum).
- **Accessibility**: Uses existing materials; no additional cost; household items suffice.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Gather Materials (5-10 minutes, before Lesson 1)**:
   - Retrieve the visual timeline and portfolio from their storage location (e.g., binder or folder).
   - Ensure a quiet space for review to help the student focus.
   - Optionally, gather markers if the student wants to add final touches.
2. **Review the Timeline (15 minutes, during Lesson 1)**:
   - Lay out the timeline on a flat surface.
   - Point to each section (Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independence, Modern, Local History) and ask the student to recall one event or item added (e.g., “What’s this pyramid from?”).
   - Use the portfolio to cross-reference crafts or drawings, prompting memories (e.g., “This mask was from the Maya”).
3. **Prepare for Presentation (10 minutes, during Lesson 1)**:
   - Help the student choose 3-5 favorite timeline items to talk about in Lesson 2 (e.g., quetzal, flag, church).
   - Practice a simple sentence for each (e.g., “The Maya made pyramids”).
   - Encourage them to think of one reason they like each item (e.g., “It’s colorful”).
4. **Enhance if Desired (5 minutes, optional)**:
   - Allow the student to add small drawings or colors to the timeline to make it presentation-ready.
   - Store the timeline safely until Lesson 2.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Review the timeline and select key items during Lesson 1 (15-25 minutes), preparing for the final presentation.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe recall during review (e.g., identifies events correctly) to gauge memory and engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**: The prepared timeline and practice sentences contribute to Lesson 2’s presentation, assessed informally through participation and enthusiasm.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage selection of more items (e.g., 5-7) or adding brief written notes to the timeline.
- **Struggling Learners**: Focus on 1-2 items; use portfolio visuals to prompt recall.
- **Visual Learners**: Emphasize timeline visuals and portfolio items to spark memories.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 5-10 minutes (before Lesson 1)
- Review and Preparation: 25 minutes (during Lesson 1)
- Enhancement (Optional): 5 minutes
- Total: 30-35 minutes (integrated into Lesson 1)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Completion of Units 1-9; familiarity with the timeline and portfolio.

- **Facilitation**: Guide the review, prompt recall, and assist with presentation practice.
- **Engagement**: Ask questions like “What’s your favorite part?” to deepen reflection.
- **Follow-Up**: Ensure the timeline is ready for Lesson 2’s presentation.

## Accommodations
