# Lesson Plan: Unit 10, Lesson 2 - Final Project Presentation

## Overview
This lesson culminates the 10-week Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum with the student’s presentation of their visual timeline to family members. Designed for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, it fosters confidence and oral expression by sharing key historical events and cultural elements learned throughout the course. Aligned with Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, the lesson emphasizes narration and the joy of learning, celebrating the student’s achievements in a homeschool setting and connecting their work to their community.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards as specified in the course rules. The lesson supports educational goals by:
- Demonstrating historical understanding through the student’s presentation, aligning with homeschool history objectives.
- Enhancing oral language skills via narration, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Providing informal assessment through the presentation, suitable for a young learner’s developmental stage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Present their visual timeline, explaining at least three key events or periods from Guatemala’s history.
2. Answer simple questions about their project from family members to demonstrate understanding.
3. Reflect on their favorite part of the course to celebrate their learning journey.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Visual Timeline**: Completed timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`, reviewed and prepared as per `units/unit10/resources/review_timeline_instructions.md` in Lesson 1.
- **Portfolio**: Optional, collection of crafts and maps from Units 1-9 for additional display, per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
- **Optional**: Props or crafts from the portfolio (e.g., Mayan mask, peace dove) to enhance the presentation.
- **Accessibility**: Uses materials already created; no additional cost; household items or existing crafts suffice.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Set the stage for the presentation and build excitement.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Gather family members or a small audience at home.
     - Say, “Today, [student’s name] will show us what they’ve learned about Guatemala’s history!”
     - Explain briefly: “They’ll use their timeline to tell us about it.”
2. **Presentation (15-20 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Share the timeline and narrate key points.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Position the student near the timeline (e.g., hung on a wall or laid on a table).
     - Prompt them to start: “Tell us about the first part of your timeline.”
     - Encourage pointing to each chosen section (e.g., “This is when the Maya lived”) and sharing a sentence or two per item selected in Lesson 1.
     - Assist if needed with gentle prompts (e.g., “What did you add here?”).
3. **Q&A and Discussion (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the audience and deepen understanding.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Invite family to ask simple questions (e.g., “What’s your favorite part?” or “Why did they fly kites?”).
     - Encourage the student to answer or say, “I don’t know, but I can find out!” to keep it low-pressure.
     - Praise their efforts: “You know so much!” or “Great job telling us!”
4. **Reflection (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Celebrate learning and reflect on the experience.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Ask, “What was the most fun thing you learned in our lessons?”
     - Share your own favorite moment as the parent (e.g., “I loved making the kite with you”).
     - Optionally, take a photo with the timeline for the portfolio as a keepsake.
5. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Conclude the presentation with celebration.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Thank the student and audience: “Thank you for sharing and listening!”
     - Say, “You’ve done an amazing job learning about Guatemala!”
     - Optionally, celebrate with a small treat (e.g., snack) or applause.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - **Presentation**: The student presents their timeline, serving as the main activity (15-20 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe confidence and recall during the presentation (e.g., clear narration of events) to assess engagement.
  - Note responses to family questions to gauge understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - The presentation acts as an informal assessment of overall course learning, evaluated through participation, enthusiasm, and ability to share key points (no formal rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage more detailed explanations (e.g., “The Maya used jade too”) or additional facts beyond the selected items.
- **Struggling Learners**: Provide prompts during the presentation or limit to one favorite section; focus on effort over detail.
- **Shy Students**: Allow presentation to a smaller audience (e.g., just parents) or use props to support narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Emphasize pointing to timeline visuals to aid storytelling.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Presentation: 15-20 minutes
- Q&A and Discussion: 10 minutes
- Reflection: 5 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 40-45 minutes (adjustable based on audience interaction)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Completion of Units 1-9; familiarity with the timeline prepared in Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to facilitate the presentation and engage the audience; familiarity with the student’s timeline selections.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Set up the timeline display (e.g., hang it up) and invite family members (~10-15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Introduce the presentation, guide the Q&A, and assist the student as needed.
- **Engagement**: Ask questions (e.g., “What’s this part about?”) and show enthusiasm to boost confidence.
- **Follow-Up**: Celebrate the student’s achievement; store the timeline and portfolio as keepsakes.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Ensure the timeline is clearly visible; describe sections aloud if needed.
- **Auditory Needs**: Speak clearly and repeat questions from the audience; allow extra response time.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with pointing or holding props; set up the timeline at an accessible height.
- **Anxiety**: Practice the presentation beforehand or limit the audience size for comfort.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes a supportive family audience; adjust timing or format if fewer people are available.
- Relies on the completed timeline from Lesson 1; if incomplete, focus on available sections.
- Assumes a home setting; adapt space as needed for visibility and comfort.
