# Field Trip Plan: Unit 10 - Family Presentation

## Overview
This field trip serves as the culminating event of the 10-week Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum, where the 7-year-old 2nd-grade student presents their visual timeline to family members at home in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. It provides an opportunity to share learning, fostering confidence and oral expression. Aligned with Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, it emphasizes narration and celebration of knowledge. Designed to be flexible, it requires minimal preparation and can be extended with an optional visit to a local exhibit in Antigua if desired, connecting the student’s work to their community.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards as specified in the course rules. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Demonstrating historical understanding through the student’s presentation, aligning with homeschool history objectives.
- Enhancing oral language skills via narration, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Providing informal assessment through the presentation, suitable for a young learner.
- Promoting cultural appreciation by sharing Guatemala’s history with family.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Present their visual timeline to an audience, explaining key historical events.
2. Engage with family members through a Q&A session to demonstrate understanding.
3. Reflect on their learning experience to celebrate their achievement.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Visual Timeline**: Completed timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`, prepared per `units/unit10/resources/review_timeline_instructions.md`.
- **Portfolio**: Optional, for additional display from Units 1-9, per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
- **Optional**: Snacks or decorations (e.g., balloons, household items) for a celebratory atmosphere.
- **Accessibility**: Uses existing materials; optional items are low-cost or household; no additional cost for the home presentation.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before the event)**:
   - **Objective**: Set up for an engaging presentation.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Choose a presentation space at home (e.g., living room).
     - Display the timeline prominently (e.g., on a wall with tape or on a table).
     - Optionally, arrange portfolio items or crafts nearby for display.
     - Invite family members and set a time (e.g., after dinner).
2. **Presentation (20-30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Share the timeline and narrate key points.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Welcome the audience: “Thank you for coming! [Student’s name] will show us Guatemala’s history.”
     - Have the student present their timeline, section by section, using sentences practiced in Lesson 1 (e.g., “This is the Maya part”).
     - Encourage family to clap or comment after each section to build confidence.
3. **Celebration (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and celebrate the student’s work.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Applaud the student: “Great job!”
     - Optionally, share a snack or small treat with the family.
     - Discuss as a group: “What did you like best?” to reinforce learning.
4. **Optional Local Exhibit Visit (1-2 hours, if chosen)**:
   - **Objective**: Connect learning to a community site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Visit a local museum or exhibit in Antigua (e.g., Museo del Jade, ~15-30 minutes by bus/car).
     - Relate exhibits to course content (e.g., “This jade is from the Maya time we learned!”).
     - Sketch or note one interesting item to add to the portfolio.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - **Presentation**: The primary activity is the timeline presentation at home (20-30 minutes).
  - **Optional Exhibit**: Sketching or observing at a local site (1-2 hours).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe presentation skills (e.g., clarity, enthusiasm) and engagement with family questions.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - The presentation serves as an informal assessment of course learning, evaluated through participation and recall; optional exhibit sketch adds to portfolio evidence.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage detailed narration or additional exhibit observations.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify to one section of the timeline; focus on effort.
- **Shy Students**: Present to a smaller group or use portfolio items as prompts.
- **Visual Learners**: Emphasize timeline visuals or exhibit displays.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 30 minutes (before event)
- Presentation: 20-30 minutes
- Celebration: 15 minutes
- Optional Exhibit Visit: 1-2 hours (if chosen)
- Total: 1-3 hours (flexible based on chosen activities)
