# Lesson Plan: Unit 10, Lesson 1 - Review of Guatemalan History

## Overview
This lesson serves as a comprehensive review of the key historical periods and cultural elements covered in the previous nine units of the Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum. Designed for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, it uses interactive activities and narration to reinforce learning and prepare for the final timeline presentation in Lesson 2. The lesson aligns with Charlotte Mason’s philosophy by emphasizing short, engaging activities and oral retelling, fostering memory and comprehension. It connects the student’s learning journey to their local context and sets the stage for the culminating project.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards as specified in the course rules. The lesson supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through review activities, aligning with homeschool history objectives.
- Enhancing language development via narration, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Preparing for informal assessment through the final project, suitable for a young learner.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Recall key events or figures from at least three historical periods covered in the course (e.g., Maya, Colonial, Independence).
2. Organize historical events in chronological order using the visual timeline.
3. Narrate a summary of their favorite unit or topic from the course.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Visual Timeline**: The completed timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`, updated weekly, as prepared in `units/unit10/resources/review_timeline_instructions.md`.
- **Portfolio**: Collection of crafts, maps, and narrations from Units 1-9, stored per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
- **Optional**: Index cards or small paper slips (household items) and markers (household or ~$2-$5) for a matching game.
- **Accessibility**: Uses materials already created in the course; no additional cost; household items suffice.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the student and introduce the review.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “We’ve learned so much about Guatemala’s history! Today, we’ll remember our favorite parts and get ready for your big project.”
     - Ask, “What was your favorite thing we learned?” to spark interest and set a positive tone.
2. **Timeline Review (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce chronological understanding.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Spread out the visual timeline on a table or floor.
     - Point to each section (Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independence, Modern, Local History) and ask, “What do you remember from this time?” Encourage brief responses (e.g., “The Maya built pyramids”).
     - Optionally, play a matching game: Write 3-5 key events or figures on index cards (e.g., “Maya pyramids,” “Spanish arrival,” “Independence flag”) and have the student place them in the correct timeline section.
3. **Portfolio Exploration (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Revisit hands-on learning to jog memory.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Open the portfolio and look through items together (e.g., Mayan mask, colonial window, peace dove).
     - For each unit, ask, “What did you make here? What does it show?” (e.g., “This is my flag from independence”).
     - Encourage the student to pick one favorite item and explain why they like it (e.g., “It’s fun to draw”).
4. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about your favorite part of Guatemala’s history.”
     - Allow free narration, then ask follow-ups (e.g., “Why did you like that?”) to deepen reflection.
     - Optionally, note key points (e.g., “Student loved the kites”) for the portfolio.
5. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Preview the final project and wrap up.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Next time, you’ll show your timeline to our family! Let’s pick a few things you want to talk about.”
     - Discuss briefly what to include (e.g., “You could say about the Maya and the church”).
     - Praise their effort: “You know so much now!”

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Timeline Review**: Interactive recall of historical periods using the timeline (15 minutes).
  - **Portfolio Exploration**: Hands-on revisiting of course outputs to reinforce learning (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe recall during timeline activity (e.g., correct placement of events) to assess memory.
  - Listen to narration for comprehension and enthusiasm to gauge engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - The review prepares for the final project in Lesson 2; assess informally through participation and ability to select key items for presentation.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage detailed narration (e.g., multiple events per period) or add a writing component (e.g., one sentence per unit).
- **Struggling Learners**: Focus on one key event per period; use portfolio pictures to prompt recall.
- **Visual Learners**: Emphasize timeline and portfolio visuals to spark memories.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Use the matching game with index cards for active participation.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Timeline Review: 15 minutes
- Portfolio Exploration: 15 minutes
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (adjustable to 45 minutes by shortening review segments)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Completion of Units 1-9; basic recall of course content through timeline and portfolio familiarity.
- **Parent**: Familiarity with the course materials and student’s prior work to guide review.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Ensure timeline and portfolio are accessible before the lesson (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Guide activities, prompt narration, and assist with optional game setup.
- **Engagement**: Share in the review by asking questions (e.g., “What surprised you most?”) and showing enthusiasm.
- **Follow-Up**: Help organize selected items for Lesson 2’s presentation; store materials safely.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use enlarged timeline sections or describe visuals aloud if needed.
- **Auditory Needs**: Repeat student’s narrations for reinforcement; speak clearly during prompts.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with handling portfolio items or timeline; skip the matching game if dexterity is an issue.
- **Attention Span**: Break activities into shorter segments (e.g., 10-minute timeline, 10-minute portfolio) with a movement break.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes completion of Units 1-9 with a populated timeline and portfolio; if incomplete, focus on available materials.
- Relies on student’s prior engagement; adapt prompts to their strongest memories if participation varied.
- Assumes a quiet space for focus; adjust setting if distractions are present.
