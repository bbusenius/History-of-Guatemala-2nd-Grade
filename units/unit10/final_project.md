# Final Project Materials for Unit 10: Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum

## Overview
This document provides instructions for the final project of the 10-week Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum, designed for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. The final project celebrates the student’s learning journey by showcasing their completed visual timeline, narrating their favorite historical period, and optionally creating a Guatemalan flag craft. It includes review activities to reinforce key concepts from Units 1-9, culminating in a presentation for family members. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods, the project emphasizes narration, creativity, and short, engaging tasks, fostering historical understanding and cultural pride with minimal preparation required.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, explicitly not following Common Core State Standards as per the course rules. The final project supports educational goals by:
- Demonstrating chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through the timeline presentation, aligning with homeschool history objectives.
- Enhancing oral language skills via narration, a Charlotte Mason emphasis, supporting language development.
- Integrating art and creativity through the optional craft, meeting cross-subject goals (art).
- Providing informal assessment via portfolio outputs and presentation, suitable for a young learner’s developmental stage.
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemala’s heritage, a core curriculum objective.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this final project, the student will be able to:
1. Present their visual timeline, explaining at least three key events or periods from Guatemala’s history (e.g., Maya pyramids, independence, peace accords).
2. Narrate their favorite historical period in detail, demonstrating recall and personal connection to the material.
3. Optionally, create a Guatemalan flag craft to symbolize national identity and reinforce learning from Unit 5 (Independence).
4. Review key concepts from the course through structured activities, reinforcing comprehension and confidence.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Visual Timeline**: Completed timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`, updated weekly across Units 1-9 with drawings, notes, or crafts (stored in a binder or displayed on a wall).
- **Portfolio**: Collection of crafts, maps, and narrations from Units 1-9, organized per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md` (e.g., Mayan mask, colonial window, peace dove).
- **Craft Supplies (Optional)**:
  - White construction paper (standard 8.5x11; household item or ~$5/pack).
  - Blue and green crayons or markers (household or ~$2-$5).
  - Scissors (household; adult supervision required).
- **Presentation Space**: A designated area at home (e.g., living room wall or table) to display the timeline.
- **Optional**: Family audience (e.g., parents, siblings) for the presentation; snacks or decorations for celebration (household items).
- **Accessibility**: Uses materials already created during the course; craft supplies are low-cost and common; no additional purchases required unless opting for the flag craft.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (15-20 minutes, before presentation day)**:
   - **Objective**: Set up the timeline and prepare the student for presenting.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Retrieve the visual timeline and portfolio from storage (e.g., binder or folder).
     - Display the timeline prominently at home (e.g., tape it to a wall or lay it on a table).
     - Review the timeline with the student, helping them choose 3-5 favorite events or periods to narrate (e.g., “I’ll talk about the Maya, the flag, and the kites”).
     - Practice simple sentences for each chosen item (e.g., “The Maya built big pyramids”).
     - If opting for the craft, gather supplies (paper, blue/green crayons, scissors).
2. **Timeline Presentation (20-30 minutes, presentation day)**:
   - **Objective**: Showcase the timeline and narrate key historical moments.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Gather family members as an audience in the presentation space.
     - Introduce the event: “Today, [student’s name] will share what they learned about Guatemala’s history!”
     - Guide the student to start: “Tell us about your timeline.” Have them point to each section (Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independence, Modern, Local History) and share one fact or story per chosen event (e.g., “This is my favorite—the independence flag!”).
     - Encourage family to clap after each section to boost confidence.
     - Allow 5-10 minutes for a Q&A: Family asks simple questions (e.g., “Why did you pick that?”), and the student answers or says, “I can find out!”
3. **Favorite Period Narration (10 minutes, during presentation)**:
   - **Objective**: Deepen engagement by focusing on a personal favorite.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt the student: “Now tell us more about your favorite part of Guatemala’s history.”
     - Encourage 2-3 sentences (e.g., “I like the Maya because they made pyramids. They lived in jungles!”).
     - Use portfolio items (e.g., a craft) to support narration if desired.
4. **Optional Craft: Guatemalan Flag (15-20 minutes, before or after presentation)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce independence themes with a creative activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Provide white paper and blue/green crayons or markers.
     - Guide the student: “Draw two blue stripes on the left and right, and a green middle. This is Guatemala’s flag from Unit 5!”
     - Optionally, draw a simple quetzal bird or wreath in the center with adult help.
     - Cut the paper into a flag shape if desired (adult supervision for scissors).
     - Display the flag with the timeline and explain: “This flag means freedom!”
5. **Review Activities (15-20 minutes, before presentation day)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning and build confidence for presenting.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Timeline Quiz (5-10 minutes)**: Point to different timeline sections and ask, “What happened here?” (e.g., “What did the Maya build?”—Pyramids). Celebrate correct answers with praise.
     - **Portfolio Reflection (10 minutes)**: Look through the portfolio together. For 3-5 items, ask, “What’s this? Why did we make it?” (e.g., “This mask is from the Maya”).
     - Keep the tone positive and supportive to prepare for the presentation.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Timeline Presentation**: The student presents their timeline to family, narrating key events (20-30 minutes).
  - **Favorite Period Narration**: The student shares their favorite historical period in detail (10 minutes).
  - **Optional Craft**: Create a Guatemalan flag to celebrate independence (15-20 minutes).
  - **Review Activities**: Quiz and portfolio reflection to reinforce learning (15-20 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Review Activities**: Evaluate recall during the quiz (e.g., identifies 3 events correctly) and portfolio discussion (e.g., explains crafts’ purpose) to assess preparation.
  - **Presentation**: Observe confidence and clarity (e.g., speaks clearly, points to sections) to gauge engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Assess the presentation for participation and recall of at least three events/periods, based on effort and enthusiasm (no formal rubric; informal observation).
  - Collect the optional flag craft and portfolio items as evidence of learning across the course, reviewed for creativity and connection to history.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Present more events (e.g., 5-7) or add detailed narration (e.g., “The Maya used stone tools”).
  - Include a written note on the flag (e.g., “Freedom 1821”).
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Focus on one event per timeline section; use portfolio props to prompt narration.
  - Simplify the craft to coloring blue/green stripes without cutting.
- **Shy Students**:
  - Present to a smaller audience (e.g., just parents) or practice beforehand with the parent.
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Emphasize timeline visuals and portfolio items to spark narration; show flag images for craft inspiration.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Encourage pointing or walking along the timeline during presentation; wave the flag craft.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 15-20 minutes (before presentation day)
- Timeline Presentation: 20-30 minutes (presentation day)
- Favorite Period Narration: 10 minutes (during presentation)
- Optional Craft: 15-20 minutes (before or after presentation)
- Review Activities: 15-20 minutes (before presentation day)
- Total: 75-100 minutes (spread across preparation and presentation day, adjustable)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Completion of Units 1-9; basic familiarity with the timeline and portfolio items; simple speaking and crafting skills.
- **Parent**: Ability to facilitate setup and guide narration; familiarity with the student’s prior work from the course.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Set up the timeline display (e.g., tape to wall) and review it with the student; gather craft supplies if needed (~15-20 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Introduce the presentation, assist with narration prompts (e.g., “What’s next?”), and manage the Q&A session.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking questions (e.g., “Why did you choose that period?”) and showing enthusiasm to boost confidence.
- **Follow-Up**: Celebrate with praise or a small treat; store the timeline, portfolio, and optional craft as keepsakes.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Ensure the timeline is clearly visible (e.g., large display, bright lighting); describe sections aloud if needed.
- **Auditory Needs**: Speak clearly during prompts; repeat audience questions for clarity; allow extra response time.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with pointing or holding crafts during presentation; pre-cut flag shapes for the craft.
- **Anxiety/Shyness**: Practice the presentation one-on-one beforehand; limit audience size (e.g., just parents) for comfort.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten the presentation to 15-20 minutes by focusing on fewer events; break review into two 10-minute sessions.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “bandera/flag,” “historia/history”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in Spanish if preferred.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes the timeline and portfolio are complete from Units 1-9; if incomplete, focus on available items and adjust narration prompts accordingly.
- Assumes a supportive family audience is available; adapt to a solo presentation with the parent if no audience is possible.
- Assumes basic craft supplies for the optional flag; substitutes (e.g., drawing on plain paper) work if materials are limited.
- Relies on a home setting with space to display the timeline; use a table or floor if wall space is unavailable.
