# Lesson Plan: Unit 5, Lesson 2 - Key Figures of Independence

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to key figures of Guatemala’s independence, focusing on Mariano Gálvez, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through a biography from "Mariano Gálvez, A Hero of Freedom," a dictation exercise, and a paper doll craft, the student will learn about Gálvez’s role and contributions to Guatemala’s early independence era. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, storytelling, and hands-on activities—it’s engaging and connects to the student’s context in San Juan del Obispo, fostering appreciation for historical figures and building on Lesson 1’s independence foundation.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses "Mariano Gálvez, A Hero of Freedom" as a narrative-driven biography to bring history to life, adhering to Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on authentic, engaging texts.
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling of Gálvez’s story to enhance memory and comprehension.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling to 10 minutes and dictation to 5 minutes to suit a young learner’s attention span.
- **Hands-On**: Includes a paper doll craft to visualize Gálvez, supporting kinesthetic learning.
- **Dictation**: Incorporates a dictation exercise to practice spelling and reinforce historical content, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s method of connecting writing to meaningful material.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Identify Mariano Gálvez as a key figure in Guatemala’s independence.
2. Retell elements of Gálvez’s story in their own words.
3. Write a dictated sentence about independence with correct spelling.
4. Create a paper doll of Gálvez to demonstrate understanding of his role.

## Materials and Resources Required

- **Craft Supplies**: Paper (standard 8.5x11, household item), scissors (household; adult supervision required), markers (household or ~$2-$5), glue (household or ~$1).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation exercise (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Image of Mariano Gálvez (e.g., search “Mariano Gálvez Guatemala” online; free printable resources).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost or free household items; biography provided in curriculum; images optional.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce key figures and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: “Guatemala became free in 1821. Today, we’ll meet someone who helped!”
     - Say, “Mariano Gálvez was a hero who worked for freedom. We’ll learn about him, write a sentence, and make a doll of him!”
     - Show the optional image if available to spark curiosity.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore Gálvez’s role through story, dictation, and craft.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "Mariano Gálvez, A Hero of Freedom" aloud with expression. Pause to show the optional image and ask, “What makes someone a hero?” (Expect answers like “Helping people.”)
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence about what Mariano did.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "Mariano helped Guatemala." (English) or "Mariano ayudó a Guatemala." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “Great job with ‘helped’!”).
     - **Craft (15 minutes)**: Provide paper, scissors, markers, and glue. Draw a simple figure (head, body, arms, legs), cut it out with adult help, and decorate (e.g., hat, coat). Say, “This is Mariano! Let’s make him look like a leader.”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about Mariano Gálvez” or “What did your doll do to help Guatemala?”
     - Encourage a short story (e.g., “He made rules for freedom”). Note a key idea (e.g., “Mariano was a leader”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Mariano helped Guatemala after it became free, making it a better place.”
     - Preview, “Soon, we’ll visit the [Museo del Libro Antiguo](field_trip.md) to see old books from independence times!”
     - **Update Timeline**: Add a hat drawing to the Independence section with the student.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "Mariano Gálvez, A Hero of Freedom" to learn his role (10 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to independence (5 minutes).
  - **Craft**: Make a paper doll to visualize Gálvez’s contribution (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., leadership, freedom) to assess comprehension.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “helped” or “ayudó”).
  - **Craft**: Observe effort and decoration (e.g., hat) to gauge engagement and understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and paper doll for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 5 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add details to the doll (e.g., book for leadership) or narrate extra facts (e.g., “He built schools”); write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-draw the doll figure for tracing; simplify narration to “What did Mariano do?”; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Use the doll as a prop while narrating (e.g., move it as if speaking).
- **Visual Learners**: Use the optional image to inspire craft details and reinforce the story.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min story, 5 min dictation, 15 min craft)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include dictation without reducing other sections)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting, drawing, and writing skills (with help); Lesson 1’s independence intro.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, assist with craft, and conduct dictation; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the biography; gather craft supplies (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the biography, dictate the sentence clearly, help with cutting and decorating, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What makes Mariano special to you?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and doll in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge biography text or use bold markers; describe the image aloud (e.g., “He’s wearing a coat”).
- **Auditory Needs**: Read slowly; repeat key phrases (e.g., “Mariano helped”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut the doll; assist with writing; use large paper.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes or craft to 10 minutes with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use “ayudó/helped” and “Guatemala/Guatemala” bilingually; allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic craft supplies; pencils substitute if markers unavailable.
- Requires adult supervision for scissors; pre-cut if no help available.
- Assumes Lesson 1 context; recap independence briefly if missed.
