# Lesson Plan: Unit 5, Lesson 2 - Guatemala's Independence Story

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to the story of Guatemala's independence within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through a narrative from "Guatemala's Independence: A Story," a dictation exercise, a composer study with "Chichicastenango" by Paco Pérez, and a drawing activity, the student will learn about the events and key figures of Guatemala's independence, particularly José Cecilio del Valle who wrote the Act of Independence. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, storytelling, and hands-on activities—it's engaging and connects to the student's context in San Juan del Obispo, fostering appreciation for historical events and building on Lesson 1's foundation on indigenous resistance.

2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore Guatemala's independence through story, music, dictation, and drawing.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "Guatemala's Independence" aloud with expression. Pause occasionally to check understanding and ask, "Why did people in Guatemala want to be free from Spain?" (Expect answers like "They wanted to make their own rules" or "Spain was far away").
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**:
      - **Objective**: Connect with an important symbol of Guatemala's independence celebrations.
      - **Procedure**:
        - Show [an image of torch runners during Guatemala's independence celebrations](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=guatemala+independence+torch+runner&t=brave&ia=images&iax=images).
        - Say, "This is a special tradition in Guatemala called the Independence Torch. People carry torches through towns and cities to celebrate independence day on September 15th."
        - Allow the student to observe the image quietly for 1 minute.
        - Then ask, "What do you notice about this picture?" and "Why do you think carrying a torch is important for independence celebrations?" (Expect responses like "The people look excited" or "The torch is bright").
        - Explain, "The torch represents freedom and the spreading of independence news from town to town. Even today, students carry torches to celebrate independence!"
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, "Let's write a sentence about who wrote Guatemala's independence document."
         - Dictate the sentence: "José Cecilio del Valle wrote the Act of Independence of Central America." (English) or "José Cecilio del Valle escribió el Acta de Independencia de Centroamérica." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., "Great job with 'independence'!").
     - **Drawing (15 minutes)**: Provide paper and crayons/markers. Guide the student: "Draw a picture showing how people might have celebrated when Guatemala became independent. You can include flags, people celebrating, or José Cecilio del Valle writing the important document."”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, "Can you tell me how Guatemala became independent?" or "Who was José Cecilio del Valle and what did he do?"
     - Encourage a short story about independence events. Note a key idea (e.g., "Guatemala voted to be free" or "José Cecilio del Valle wrote the independence document") for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, "On September 15, 1821, Guatemala became independent from Spain. José Cecilio del Valle wrote the document that made it official."
     - Preview, "Soon, we'll visit the [Museo del Libro Antiguo](field_trip.md) to see old books from independence times!"
     - **Update Timeline**: Add a drawing of the independence celebration to the timeline's Independence section with the student.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "Guatemala's Independence" to learn about independence events (10 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss an image of torch runners during Guatemala's independence celebrations (5 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence about José Cecilio del Valle to practice spelling and connect to independence (5 minutes).
  - **Drawing**: Create a picture of independence celebrations to visualize the historical event (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., dates, key figures, voting) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Note the student's observations about the torch runners (e.g., "They're carrying flames" or "They look excited") to assess visual engagement and understanding of symbols.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of "independence" or "Valle").
  - **Drawing**: Observe inclusion of independence elements (e.g., flags, people celebrating, torches) to gauge engagement and understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and drawing for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 5 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add more details to their independence drawing (e.g., specific scenes from the story) or narrate extra facts (e.g., "There were 23 votes for independence"); write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Provide a simpler dictation sentence (e.g., "José wrote an important paper"); simplify narration to "What happened when Guatemala became free?"; offer drawing prompts.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out a scene from independence (e.g., pretend to write the Act of Independence) while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use the optional images to inspire drawing details and reinforce the story.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 35 minutes (10 min story, 5 min picture study, 5 min dictation, 15 min drawing)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 55 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic drawing and writing skills (with help); Lesson 1's introduction to resistance against Spanish rule.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, guide drawing activities, conduct dictation, and play audio; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the independence story; gather drawing supplies; find an image of torch runners (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the story, guide picture study discussion, dictate the sentence clearly, guide drawing activity, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, "How would you feel if you were there when Guatemala became independent?"
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and drawing in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge story text or use bold markers; describe the torch runner image in detail (e.g., "This shows people running with bright flames").
- **Auditory Needs**: Read slowly; repeat key phrases (e.g., "José Cecilio del Valle").
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with writing; use larger paper for drawing; provide drawing templates if needed.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes or drawing to 10 minutes with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use key terms bilingually (e.g., "independence/independencia", "torch/antorcha"); allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic drawing supplies; pencils are sufficient if markers/crayons unavailable.
- Assumes Lesson 1 context about Tzul and Aguilar; briefly recap indigenous resistance if needed.
- Assumes access to an image of torch runners; if unavailable, a verbal description can be provided.
