# Field Trip Plan: Unit 5 - Museo del Libro Antiguo

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on Guatemala’s independence by visiting the Museo del Libro Antiguo in Antigua, Guatemala, connecting Unit 5’s Lessons 1 and 2 (Road to Independence and Key Figures) to historical documents and artifacts. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration, this optional 2-3 hour trip leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of independence-related artifacts.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemala’s independence heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Observe historical documents or artifacts related to Guatemala’s independence (e.g., old books, maps).
2. Connect the museum visit to Lessons 1-2 about independence and key figures.
3. Sketch one artifact or document, demonstrating engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo by bus or car).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos (to aid narration), magnifying glass for details (household).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; museum entry is approximately $2-$3 per person (verify current rates); transportation costs vary (e.g., bus ~$1-$2).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for an educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and say, “We’re visiting a museum to see old books from independence time!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a bag.
     - Plan transportation (e.g., bus or car); check museum hours (typically 9 AM - 5 PM).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the museum.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at the museum; point out the entrance: “This place has books from long ago!”
     - Say, “We’ll look for things about independence and draw one.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with artifacts and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Explore exhibits with old books, maps, or independence documents (e.g., printing press, historical texts).
     - Ask, “What do you think this was used for?” (e.g., “To tell people about freedom”).
     - Sketch one item (e.g., a book) in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines/colors.
     - Allow free exploration if time permits.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch: “What did you draw? Why?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn?” and depart with all items.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one artifact (e.g., book, map) in 15-20 minutes, noting its purpose (e.g., “For writing freedom”).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to wrap-up reflections (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the sketch for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess recall and connection to lessons informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple items or add a note (e.g., “This is from 1821”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw basic shapes (e.g., a rectangle for a book); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to exhibits while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or a magnifying glass for detail focus.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 30 minutes
- Arrival/Orientation: 10 minutes
- Exploration/Activity: 1-2 hours
- Wrap-Up/Departure: 15 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (flexible)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic drawing skills; Unit 5 lessons on independence.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Plan transport, pack materials.
- **Facilitation**: Guide exploration, assist with sketching, prompt questions.
- **Engagement**: Discuss observations (e.g., “How is this book old?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct discussion, store sketch in portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe artifacts aloud; use a magnifying glass.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist sketching; photograph instead.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten to 1 hour with breaks.
