# Field Trip Plan: Unit 5 - MUNAG (Museo Nacional de Arte de Guatemala)

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It connects to Unit 5's Lessons 1 and 2 (Road to Independence and Key Figures) by visiting the MUNAG (Museo Nacional de Arte de Guatemala) in Antigua, Guatemala. While the museum primarily features a diverse collection of art spanning multiple periods (including modern, precolumbian Maya, and colonial), we will visit the "Época Republicana" section on the second floor, which has an excellent display of independence-related pieces including the acta de independencia, sheet music and lyrics for the himno nacional de Guatemala, and many other artifacts from that period. We will also look for the "escudo de Guatemala" (coat of arms). Using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration, this optional 2-3 hour trip leverages the student's proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason's philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of Guatemalan art across different time periods.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by exploring Guatemala's artistic heritage across various time periods.
- Building connections between lessons on Maya and colonial periods through art, while looking for independence-related elements when possible.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Observe artwork and artifacts from various periods in Guatemalan history, looking for the national coat of arms (escudo de Guatemala) if available.
2. Make connections between art viewed and previous lessons, including independence themes when relevant.
3. Identify differences between artistic styles across different periods (Maya, colonial, modern).
4. Sketch one artwork or artifact, demonstrating engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo by bus or car).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, colored pencils/crayons (household or ~$2-$5).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for an educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and say, "We're visiting an art museum to see Guatemalan paintings from different time periods!"
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils, and colored pencils in a bag.
     - Plan transportation (e.g., bus or car); check museum hours.
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the museum and its historical building.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at the museum located at Palacio de los Capitanes Generales in Antigua; point out the entrance.
     - Tell the student: "This building is called the Palace of the Captain Generals. It was built starting in 1558 and was the center of government for all of Central America during colonial times."
     - Walk to the North side of the building across from the park to see the historical plaque and read it together.
     - Say, "We'll look for art from different time periods in Guatemala's history, and see if we can find the special coat of arms of Guatemala."
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with artwork and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Visit the "Época Republicana" section on the second floor to see the excellent independence-related collection.
     - Examine the acta de independencia (declaration of independence), sheet music and lyrics for the national anthem (himno nacional), and other historical artifacts from this time period.
     - Look for the escudo de Guatemala (coat of arms) and discuss its connection to independence.
     - Explore exhibits with paintings and artwork from various periods (Maya, colonial, modern).
     - Compare different artistic styles: "How is this Maya art different from colonial art?"
     - Make connections to our lessons: "Remember when we learned about Guatemala's independence? Here is the actual document declaring independence!"
     - Ask, "What do you think this painting shows?" when looking at interesting pieces.
     - Sketch one artwork that catches your interest in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines/colors.
     - Allow free exploration if time permits.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch: "What did you draw? Why did you choose this?"
     - Ask, "What did you learn about Guatemala's independence from the art?" and depart with all items.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one artwork that interests the student in 15-20 minutes, noting what period it's from.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to wrap-up reflections (e.g., "What type of art did you find most interesting?").
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the sketch for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess recall and connection to previous lessons informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple items or add a note (e.g., “This is from 1821”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw basic shapes (e.g., a rectangle for a book); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to exhibits while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or a magnifying glass for detail focus.
