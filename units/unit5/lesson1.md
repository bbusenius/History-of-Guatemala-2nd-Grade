# Lesson Plan: Unit 5, Lesson 1 - The Story of Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar

## Overview
This lesson introduces the story of Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar, indigenous leaders who led a rebellion against Spanish rule in 1820, as part of our 10-week homeschool curriculum for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student in San Juan del Obispo. Through storytelling with a living book excerpt about their courageous stand, picture study of indigenous leaders, a composer study with traditional Guatemalan music, a dictation exercise, and drawing, the student will learn about this important moment in Guatemala's journey toward independence. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, and hands-on activities—it connects to the student's national heritage near Antigua, building on Unit 4's colonial focus and enriching cultural understanding through art and music.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses an [excerpt from the provided resource file](resources/Atanasio_Tzul_and_Lucas_Aguilar.md) to provide a narrative-driven introduction, per Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on engaging texts over dry summaries.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling to enhance comprehension and memory, fostering active engagement with the material.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling, picture study, and composer study to concise segments (e.g., 5 minutes each) to maintain focus suitable for a young learner.
- **Picture Study**: Adds a 5-minute segment with images of indigenous leaders to foster observation and cultural context, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s art appreciation approach.
- **Composer Study**: Incorporates a 5-minute listening activity with traditional Guatemalan music to deepen historical understanding through auditory arts, complementing art appreciation as per Charlotte Mason’s holistic approach.
- **Hands-On**: Includes drawing to engage kinesthetic learning with historical themes, making abstract concepts tangible.

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce the story of Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 4: "We learned that the Spanish ruled Guatemala for a long time and made the indigenous people pay taxes. Today, we'll learn about two men who refused to collect taxes for the Spanish. Their names were Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar. Let's hear their story"
2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the story of Tzul and Aguilar through storytelling, picture study, composer study, dictation, and drawing.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read the [story of Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar](resources/Atanasio_Tzul_and_Lucas_Aguilar.md). Show the [statue of Atanasio Tzul in Totonicapan](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=atanasio+tzul+estatua&t=brave&iar=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fmayatecum.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2F126901795_1532460066955364_6189067816083581640_n.jpg) to help visualize the character.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Listening to a living book excerpt to learn about Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar.
  - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Observing and discussing images of indigenous leaders to appreciate their role visually.
  - **Composer Study (5 minutes)**: Listening to traditional Guatemalan music to deepen historical understanding through auditory arts.
  - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence to practice spelling and reinforce the story's key figures.
  - **Drawing (10 minutes)**: Creating a scene from the story to visualize this historical event creatively.
  - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence to practice spelling and reinforce the historical narrative.
  - **Drawing (10 minutes)**: Creating an independence scene to visualize the historical moment creatively.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen for narration details (e.g., “They were free,” “They celebrated”) to assess comprehension of the event.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “I saw a flag” or “It’s blue”) for memory and attention to detail.
  - **Composer Study**: Note reflections on the music (e.g., “It’s happy”) to gauge emotional engagement and connection to the historical mood.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct letters in “free” or “liberó”) to assess writing skills.
  - **Drawing**: Observe inclusion of independence elements (e.g., flag, people, musical symbols) to gauge engagement and creativity.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and drawing for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and relevance (e.g., includes key ideas like freedom or celebration).
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 5 connection, focusing on creativity and link to independence (no formal rubric; based on engagement and effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage a detailed drawing with multiple elements (e.g., flag, people, instruments) or narrate extra details (e.g., “They played music all day”); add a second dictation sentence (e.g., “People danced”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify drawing to one item (e.g., a flag); shorten narration prompt to “What happened?”; allow tracing for dictation or provide a pre-written sentence to copy.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Wave a pretend flag or tap a rhythm from the music while narrating to involve movement.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional flag images or emphasize the picture study and music visuals (e.g., imagine marimba players) to inspire drawing and discussion.
- **Auditory Learners**: Emphasize the composer study by replaying a short segment or humming along; encourage sound descriptions in narration (e.g., “The music was fast”).

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 35 minutes (10 min storytelling, 5 min picture study, 5 min composer study, 5 min dictation, 10 min drawing)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 55 minutes (within the adjustable 30-60 minute range specified in the original course request)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, drawing, and writing skills (e.g., can hold a pencil and form letters with guidance); familiarity with the colonial period from Unit 4 to understand the transition to independence.
- **Parent**: Ability to source an ebook excerpt and image online, play a short audio clip, and assist with drawing and dictation; no historical expertise required, as instructions are provided.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Source the living book excerpt (e.g., preview *Central America* on Google Books or purchase *Guatemala ABCs* ebook) and independence painting image online (~10-15 minutes); find a suitable marimba piece on YouTube (~5 minutes); gather drawing supplies (household items).
- **Facilitation**: Read the excerpt aloud with enthusiasm, present the picture study, play the music clip clearly, dictate the sentence slowly, guide drawing with prompts, and lead narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by joining the discussion (e.g., “What would you do if we got free?”) or tapping along to the music to model engagement and make it fun.
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and drawing in the portfolio (e.g., a binder or folder); update the timeline with the student’s sketch, praising their effort (e.g., “Your flag looks amazing!”).

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the excerpt text and painting image (e.g., zoom on a device or print larger); describe visuals aloud (e.g., “The painting shows people with blue and white flags”); use high-contrast crayons for drawing visibility.
- **Auditory Needs**: Provide a written summary of the story if needed (e.g., jot key points on paper); play music at a clear volume and repeat key phrases during dictation (e.g., “Guatemala… became…”); allow extra time for narration responses.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with drawing by providing a pre-drawn outline (e.g., a flag shape) or holding the paper steady; allow tracing for dictation or scribe the sentence if writing is difficult; use larger crayons for easier grip.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes or drawing to 8 minutes, inserting a 2-minute stretch break between activities; keep the music clip brief (e.g., 2 minutes) to maintain focus.
- **Language Support**: Offer the dictation sentence in both English and Spanish (e.g., repeat “Guatemala became free” and “Guatemala se liberó”); use bilingual terms during discussion (e.g., “libertad/freedom,” “bandera/flag”); allow narration in the student’s preferred language for comfort.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes internet access for sourcing the excerpt, image, and music; offline alternatives include using a library book for the story (e.g., a local history book), a parent-drawn sketch for picture study, or humming a simple tune if no audio device is available.
- Assumes drawing supplies are accessible in the household; if crayons or markers are unavailable, pencils or any coloring tool suffice as substitutes.
- Assumes Unit 4’s colonial context is understood; if not, recap briefly during the introduction (e.g., “The Spanish ruled before, and now we’ll see what changed”).
- Relies on a quiet space for music listening; if noise is an issue, use headphones or choose a calm time of day.
