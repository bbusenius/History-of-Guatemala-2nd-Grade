## Biography Text: "Mariano Gálvez, A Hero of Freedom"
A long time ago, when Guatemala was ruled by Spain, there lived a man named Mariano Gálvez. He was born in a town not far from here, and he loved his country very much. Mariano was a smart leader who wanted people to be treated fairly.

When Guatemala was trying to become free, Mariano worked hard to help. He didn’t fight with swords, but with words and ideas. He talked to important people and said, “Guatemala should make its own rules, not follow Spain’s!”

On September 15, 1821, when Guatemala became independent, Mariano cheered with everyone else. But his work didn’t stop. Later, he became a big leader—like a boss for the whole country. He made new rules to help schools, roads, and poor families.

Some people didn’t like his ideas, but Mariano never gave up. He wanted Guatemala to be strong and happy. Today, we remember him as a hero who helped make our country free.

Mariano Gálvez showed that even one person can make a big difference with courage and kindness.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Parent reads the biography aloud during Lesson 2’s main activity (15 minutes), integrating it with the craft activity to reinforce Gálvez’s role visually.
- **Formative Assessment**: During Lesson 2 narration (10 minutes), prompt “Tell me about Mariano Gálvez” or “How did he help Guatemala?” Listen for key details (e.g., leadership, freedom) to assess understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect narration notes (e.g., “Mariano made Guatemala free”) or an optional craft-related drawing for the portfolio, evaluating engagement and comprehension informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage a detailed retelling (e.g., “What rules did he make?”) or draw Gálvez.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify prompts to “What did Mariano do?” and use the image to aid recall.
- **Auditory Learners**: Emphasize expressive reading to enhance engagement.
- **Visual Learners**: Pair the story with the image or a prop (e.g., a hat) to reinforce concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 5 minutes (printing or loading biography, gathering visuals)
- Reading and Discussion: 15 minutes (within Lesson 2’s main activity)
- Total: 20 minutes (integrated into Lesson 2’s 45-minute structure)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening skills; familiarity with independence from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud with expression; no prior historical knowledge required.

## Accommodations

- **Auditory Needs**: Read slowly with clear enunciation; repeat key phrases (e.g., “He helped make us free”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Allow verbal narration only if crafting is difficult; parent can scribe notes.

## Assumptions and Limitations
