# Atanasio Tzul, Lucas Aguilar, and the Revolt in Totonicapan

In the early 1800s, in the mountainous region of Totonicapan, Guatemala, two Indigenous leaders, Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar, led a strong rebellion against Spanish colonial rule. This area, home to native peoples long before Europeans arrived, had faced centuries of foreign control. The Spanish king, ruling from far away, demanded a tax called “tribute” from the Indigenous population—a payment that pushed many deeper into poverty.

Atanasio Tzul was a key leader in San Miguel Totonicapan, coming from a respected line of Indigenous families with influence before the Spanish conquest. Chosen by Spanish officials to help collect tribute, he understood how heavily it weighed on his people. Lucas Aguilar, however, came from simpler roots. A successful small farmer and leader of a cofradía (a religious group honoring saints), he held great influence among the Indigenous people, despite not being from a noble family.

The tribute tax, a constant source of anger, grew worse with new rules in the early 1800s, stirring unrest in Totonicapan. In 1812, Spain’s new constitution suggested equality across the empire, leading the Indigenous people to believe the tax would end. But in 1814, the Spanish king brought it back, causing confusion and bitterness. Tzul and Aguilar led at least one delegation to Guatemala City, the center of colonial power, to seek relief from the tribute. They were told the tax would continue and returned empty-handed.

By 1820, frustration sparked action. Tzul and Aguilar urged the Indigenous people of Totonicapan to refuse the tribute. In a bold move, Tzul took the staff of office from the Spanish gobernador and declared himself king, a choice supported by his people as a challenge to local colonial leaders, not the distant Spanish crown. For days, they celebrated with music, dancing, bullfights, and fireworks. Tzul wore a Spanish soldier’s hat and sword, sitting on a throne beside Aguilar in the town hall.

During the uprising, the Indigenous people turned their rage on those who supported the Spanish. They captured Indigenous officials who had collected the tax, beating them harshly and threatening worse. Ladinos (people of mixed or European descent) were questioned and punished; some were tied up and whipped in public as a warning. Aguilar, taking charge, ordered the whipping of officials from nearby towns and set a new tax to restore community funds used in the fight against tribute. Groups of Indigenous people roamed the streets, attacking Spanish allies with fists and clubs, seizing control of San Miguel Totonicapan.

The colonial government refused to allow this defiance. With few regular soldiers available, they gathered a militia of about one thousand ladinos and castas from nearby areas. On August 3, 1820, this force attacked San Miguel. The Indigenous fought back, throwing stones and swinging clubs, while others from surrounding villages ambushed the militia with simple weapons. The battle turned violent: the militia struck with whips and swords, looted homes, and left destruction behind. One woman died, stabbed by a bayonet, and many others were injured. Tzul and Aguilar were captured without resistance and sent to Quetzaltenango for trial.

In court, the two leaders both denied their roles in the uprising, each blaming the other. They remained in prison until March 1821, when Spanish officials, facing growing political chaos, granted them pardons as Guatemala moved closer to independence.

The revolt in Totonicapan was not a fight for independence from Spain. It aimed to end the tribute tax and punish local leaders who mistreated the Indigenous people. Still, this uprising added to the mounting troubles that led to Guatemala’s independence in 1821.
