# Guatemala's Independence

## A Long Time Ago...

A long time ago, Guatemala was not its own country. It was part of Spain's empire. Spain is a country very far away across the ocean. The Captaincy General of Guatemala included lands that today are Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.

## Why Did Guatemala Want to Be Free?

There were several important reasons why Guatemala and other parts of Central America wanted independence from Spain:

1. **Influence from Other Independence Movements**: Other Spanish colonies in America were declaring their independence. The United States had already become independent from England, and countries in South America were becoming free from Spain too.

2. **Changes in Spain**: In the early 1800s, Spain was having many problems. Napoleon of France had invaded Spain and removed the Spanish king from power. This created confusion about who should rule the colonies.

3. **Local Leadership**: Important Central American leaders like **José Cecilio del Valle** (who later was a key contributor to the Act of Independence) began discussing the possibility of governing themselves.

4. **Economic Reasons**: The Spanish government had rules that made it hard for people in the colonies to trade freely and develop their own businesses.

## Important Events Before Independence

Several important events happened on the road to independence:

1. **The 1811 Movement**: On November 5, 1811, there was an uprising in San Salvador (now the capital of El Salvador). Led by Father José Matías Delgado, people gathered at the town square where Manuel José Arce announced that they didn't need to obey Spanish officials anymore. The Spanish authorities eventually stopped this movement.

2. **The Totonicapan Rebellion**: In 1820, two Indigenous leaders, Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar, led a rebellion in Totonicapan, Guatemala. They were protesting against the tribute tax that the Spanish government made Indigenous people pay. While they weren't fighting for independence from Spain, their rebellion added to the growing unrest just before independence was declared.

3. **Mexico's Independence**: In 1821, Mexico declared its independence from Spain. This news reached Guatemala and influenced leaders there.

4. **News from Spain**: News about political changes in Spain reached Central America and led to discussions about the future of the region.

## The Big Day: September 15, 1821

On September 15, 1821, important officials met at the Royal Palace in Guatemala City to discuss independence. After debating the issue, they held a vote. The declaration of independence was approved with 23 votes in favor and 7 votes against.

**José Cecilio del Valle** was a key contributor to the "Act of Independence of Central America." While he played a significant role in drafting the document due to his legal expertise, the Act was a collaborative effort with multiple authors ("Varios autores"). This important document announced that Central America was separating from the Spanish Empire. It was signed by representatives from the provinces of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.

## What Happened After?

After declaring independence, several important things happened:

1. **Union with Mexico**: On January 5, 1822, Central America joined the Mexican Empire. This happened after Mexico sent a letter proposing that Central America join them under the Plan of Iguala.

2. **The Federal Republic**: After Mexico became a republic in 1823, Central America separated from Mexico and formed the Federal Republic of Central America.

3. **Separate Countries**: Eventually, the Federal Republic broke apart, and Guatemala began to establish itself independently.

4. **Republic of Guatemala**: On March 21, 1847, Guatemala was officially declared a sovereign state. This important date marked the beginning of the Republican period in Guatemala's history, when it formally became its own country, completely separate from the Central American union.
