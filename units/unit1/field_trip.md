# Field Trip Plan: Unit 1 - Casa del Jade (Mesoamerican Jade Museum)

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum exploring Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the Maya civilization, providing a hands-on opportunity to connect classroom learning from Unit 1 (Introduction to Guatemala and the Maya) with real-world experiences near Antigua, Guatemala. The trip incorporates Charlotte Mason-inspired methods, such as observation and narration, to engage the student in a meaningful and memorable way. Designed to be flexible and requiring minimal preparation, this 2-3 hour optional field trip enhances the student’s understanding of Guatemalan history and culture, leveraging their proximity to San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements, emphasizing flexible, child-centered learning inspired by Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. It does not follow Common Core State Standards, as specified in the course rules. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through direct observation of Maya jade artifacts.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussions, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s focus on oral expression.
- Integrating cross-curricular elements (e.g., geography through the trip’s location, art through sketching) to meet broad homeschool learning objectives.
- Promoting cultural appreciation, connecting the student to their local and national Maya heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify jade as a significant material in Maya culture and describe its importance.
2. Connect observations of jade artifacts to prior lessons about the Maya (e.g., their daily life and achievements).
3. Complete a simple sketching activity of a jade artifact to demonstrate engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Field Trip Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing and shoes, transportation to the Casa del Jade in Antigua.
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or plain paper), pencils, crayons.
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for safety and engagement tips (already provided in the curriculum).
- **Optional**: Camera or smartphone for photos (to aid post-trip narration), magnifying glass for closer observation of artifacts.
- **Accessibility**: Most materials are household items; museum entry fees can be checked on the [website](https://casadeljade.com/mesoamerican-museum-of-jade/); transportation costs depend on the family’s method (e.g., bus fare or gas).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (15-30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe and engaging trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the trip’s purpose: “We’re visiting Casa del Jade to see Maya jade artifacts and learn how they lived.”
     - Check [Casa del Jade’s website](https://casadeljade.com/mesoamerican-museum-of-jade/) for current hours (typically Monday-Sunday, 9:30 AM - 6:00 PM) and entry fees.
     - Pack essentials: water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils, and optional camera or magnifying glass.
     - Plan transportation: ~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo by bus (to Central Park, Antigua) or car (parking available). Address: Edificio "El Jaulón", 4a Calle Ote. 10, Antigua Guatemala 03001.
     - Dress in comfortable clothing and shoes for walking through the museum.
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10-15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the museum.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at the Casa del Jade and locate the jade exhibit area.
     - Provide a brief overview: “This museum has jade that the Maya carved into jewelry and tools.”
     - Set expectations: “We’ll look at the jade and draw one piece you like.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the museum and complete the sketching activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Guide the student through the jade exhibits, pointing out artifacts like necklaces, figurines, or tools.
     - Encourage observation: “What color is this jade? Does it look smooth or rough?”
     - Supervise the sketching activity: Choose one artifact to draw in the sketchbook, noting its shape and details (e.g., “It’s green and has a face”). Allow 15-20 minutes for sketching.
     - Explore other exhibits if time permits, noting anything interesting for discussion.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15-30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect briefly and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch and ask, “What did you learn about jade today?”
     - Discuss one observation (e.g., “This necklace was for someone important”).
     - Depart the museum, ensuring all belongings are collected.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - Sketch one jade artifact and note its features (e.g., “It’s green and shiny”) during the exploration phase (15-20 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe engagement during sketching (e.g., focus, curiosity about artifacts).
  - Listen to initial reflections at wrap-up (e.g., “What did you see?”) to gauge understanding of jade’s role.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Use the sketch and “Post-Trip Discussion” questions at home to assess recall and connection to Unit 1 lessons (e.g., jade in Maya culture).
  - Collect the sketch for the portfolio, evaluating participation and basic comprehension informally (no rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Sketch multiple artifacts or add a short written note (e.g., “This was a necklace for a king”).
  - Encourage detailed observations (e.g., “How do you think they carved this?”).
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Simplify to sketching one feature (e.g., just the shape or color).
  - Use a camera to capture an artifact instead, discussing it later.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Encourage mimicking artifact shapes with hands or touching replicas (if allowed).
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Use photos taken during the trip or a magnifying glass to focus on details.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 15-30 minutes (before departure)
- Arrival and Orientation: 10-15 minutes
- Exploration and Activity: 1-2 hours
- Wrap-Up and Departure: 15-30 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (flexible based on parent’s schedule)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic observation and drawing skills (developed in Lesson 1’s map activity); familiarity with the Maya from Unit 1 lessons.
- **Parent**: Ability to plan logistics (e.g., transportation, timing); basic facilitation skills (e.g., guiding observation, prompting questions).

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Review this plan, gather materials, and arrange transportation to Antigua (e.g., bus or car).
- **Facilitation**: Accompany the student, guide them through exhibits, and assist with sketching (e.g., holding the sketchbook).
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing observations (e.g., “What do you think this jade was used for?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct the post-trip discussion at home and store the sketch in the student’s portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe artifacts aloud; use a magnifying glass if needed for small details.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with sketching (e.g., trace outlines) or use a camera instead.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten the visit to 1 hour or take a snack break midway.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “jade/jade,” “museo/museum”) to reinforce learning.

## Assumptions and Limitations
