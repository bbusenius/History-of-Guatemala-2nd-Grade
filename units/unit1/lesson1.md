# Unit 1, Lesson 1: Geography and Introduction to the Maya

### Overview
This lesson introduces the geography of Guatemala and the Maya civilization to a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, as part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through map coloring, storytelling with living books—including a chapter from *Popol Vuh para niños* to provide an authentic Maya perspective—and a copywork activity, the student explores Guatemala’s location and the Maya’s foundational role. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods like narration, short lessons, and hands-on activities, it fosters curiosity and cultural sensitivity, emphasizing indigenous viewpoints to balance historical narratives.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Incorporates excerpts from *The Corn Grows Ripe* or *The Bird Who Cleans the World and Other Mayan Fables* for narrative engagement, supplemented by a chapter from *Popol Vuh para niños* to provide an authentic Maya voice, avoiding simplified "twaddle."
- **Narration**: Prompts oral retelling of stories to build comprehension and personal connection to the material.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments storytelling into 10-minute and 5-minute parts, keeping activities concise for focus.
- **Hands-On**: Uses map coloring to engage kinesthetic learners and reinforce geography.
- **Support for Natural Curiosity**: Introduces Maya culture through storytelling, encouraging exploration of their beliefs and traditions.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Highlights Maya perspectives via *Popol Vuh para niños*, fostering respect for indigenous heritage.

### Learning Objectives
1. Locate Guatemala on a map of Central America and identify its borders.
2. Recognize the Maya as a key civilization in Guatemala’s history through living book narratives.
3. Retell elements of both the living book excerpt and the *Popol Vuh para niños* chapter, including a Maya cultural belief (e.g., creation from corn).
4. Complete a copywork sentence to practice handwriting and connect to Maya culture.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Printable Map**: Blank Central America map from `resources/map_of_guatemala.pdf` (provided in curriculum) or online (e.g., [National Geographic Kids](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/guatemala), free PDF printable).

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage curiosity and set the lesson’s focus.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Ask, “Where do we live? What country?” to connect to the student’s experience.
     - Say, “Today, we’ll find Guatemala on a map and hear stories about the Maya who lived here first—including their own tale from *Popol Vuh* about how they began!”
     - Show the blank map, pointing to Central America, and briefly introduce the Maya.
2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore geography and Maya culture through hands-on and narrative activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Map Coloring (10 minutes)**: Provide the map and crayons. Guide the student to color Guatemala in a chosen color (e.g., “Let’s make Guatemala green!”) and label it with “Guatemala.” Point out borders (e.g., “Mexico is up here”). Ask, “What’s near our town?”
     - **Storytelling from Living Book (10 minutes)**: Read pages 4-11 from *The Ancient Maya* (The Maya - Cities and Temples) or *The Bird Who Cleans the World* (e.g., a quetzal fable). 
       - Read to the child, allow the child to read on his or her own, or take turns reading with the child
       - Show the quetzal image if available. Ask, “What’s special about the quetzal to the Maya?” (Expect answers like “It’s free” or “It’s pretty”).
     - **Reading from *Popol Vuh para niños* (10 minutes)**: Read a short, age-appropriate chapter, such as the creation story, from *Popol Vuh para niños*. Say, “This is what the Maya believed about how people were made!” Ask, “Why was corn so important to them?” (Expect answers like “They ate it” or “They were made from it”).
     - **Copywork (5 minutes)**: Provide paper or notebook. Write a sentence or the entire paragraph from the "Copywork Paragraph" section above. Say, “Copy this neatly to practice writing and learn about the Maya.” Guide the student to write it once or twice, focusing on letter formation.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through oral retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the Maya stories or the map.” Encourage inclusion of both tales (e.g., “The boy worked hard” and “They came from corn”).
     - Listen for key details and note a significant phrase (e.g., “The Maya used corn”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview the next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “We found Guatemala and learned how the Maya lived and believed they were made from corn.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll explore more about their daily life!”
     - Add a quetzal or corn drawing to the timeline’s Pre-Columbian section with the student.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Map Coloring (10 minutes)**: Coloring and labeling Guatemala on a map to learn its geography.
  - **Storytelling from Living Book (10 minutes)**: Listening to an excerpt about Maya life or the quetzal to introduce their culture.
  - **Reading from *Popol Vuh para niños* (10 minutes)**: Hearing a chapter to gain an authentic Maya perspective.
  - **Copywork (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence to connect to Maya agriculture and practice handwriting.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Map Coloring**: Check if Guatemala is correctly colored and labeled; ask, “Where’s Guatemala?” to assess geographical recall.
  - **Storytelling**: Listen for details in narration (e.g., daily tasks, quetzal) to gauge understanding.
  - **Reading from *Popol Vuh para niños***: Evaluate if the student mentions corn’s role (e.g., “They were made from it”) to assess grasp of indigenous beliefs.
  - **Copywork**: Observe handwriting neatness and spelling accuracy (e.g., correct “corn” or “maíz”) to assess writing skills.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the map and copywork for the portfolio, assessing participation and connection to objectives informally (e.g., map shows Guatemala, copywork reflects Maya culture). No formal rubric; based on effort and inclusion of key ideas.
  - In Week 10, review timeline drawings for Unit 1 connection, evaluating creativity and relevance.

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label neighboring countries on the map (e.g., Mexico); narrate detailed story elements (e.g., “The boy farmed and the corn made people”); write the copywork sentence twice or do it in English and Spanish; read on his or her own.
- **Struggling Learners**: Use a pre-colored map with Guatemala outlined; simplify narration to “What did the Maya do?”; allow tracing for copywork.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Trace map borders with fingers before coloring; act out planting corn during storytelling.
- **Visual Learners**: Emphasize the quetzal image or show additional Maya culture visuals (e.g., corn) to aid narration and copywork.

### Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 35 minutes (10 min map coloring, 10 min storytelling, 10 min *Popol Vuh para niños* reading, 5 min copywork)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (within the adjustable 30-60 minute range)

### Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic literacy (listening and simple writing); fine motor skills for coloring and writing; no prior historical knowledge required.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, assist with map labeling, and guide copywork; no specialized skills needed as resources are provided.

### Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Source *Popol Vuh para niños* via local bookstores (e.g., Librería Sophos) or online, download or access the other ebooks, print or draw the map, and gather crayons and paper (~15-20 minutes total).
- **Facilitation**: Guide map coloring, read both stories aloud expressively, show the quetzal image if available, assist with copywork, and prompt narration with questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing, “What do you think the Maya liked about corn?” or “Have you seen a quetzal?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the map and copywork in the portfolio; add a timeline drawing with the student.

### Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map and story text; describe the quetzal image (e.g., “It’s a green bird with a long tail”); use high-contrast crayons.
- **Auditory Needs**: Read slowly with clear enunciation; repeat key phrases (e.g., “made from corn”); allow narration in short bursts.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label the map or use stickers; provide larger crayons or assist with writing; simplify copywork to tracing if needed.
- **Attention Span**: Break storytelling into two parts (7 min living book, 3 min *Popol Vuh para niños*) with a short movement break; adjust activities as needed.
- **Language Support**: Offer copywork in both English and Spanish; use bilingual terms (e.g., “maíz/corn,” “quetzal/quetzal”); allow narration in the preferred language.

### Assumptions and Limitations
