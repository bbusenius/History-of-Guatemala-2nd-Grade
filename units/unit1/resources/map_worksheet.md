# Map Worksheet: Introduction to Guatemala

## Overview
This resource is a printable worksheet for Unit 1, Lesson 1: Geography and Introduction to the Maya, featuring a map activity to color and label Guatemala. It builds geographical awareness and connects to the reusable map (`resources/map_of_guatemala.pdf`), introducing the student to Guatemala’s location in Central America. Designed for a 7-year-old, it uses Charlotte Mason-inspired methods like hands-on engagement and narration.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum follows homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not Common Core State Standards. The worksheet supports educational goals by:
- Integrating geography with history to contextualize Guatemalan heritage.
- Enhancing spatial skills through mapping.
- Encouraging narration as students describe their map.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this worksheet, the student will be able to:
1. Locate Guatemala on a map of Central America.
2. Color and label Guatemala accurately on the worksheet.
3. Identify Guatemala’s position relative to its borders during narration.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Map**: Reusable map from `resources/map_of_guatemala.pdf` (blank outline of Central America) or a downloaded blank Central America map.  
  - **Source**: Curriculum package or free online (e.g., National Geographic Kids: https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/guatemala).  
- **Crayons or Colored Pencils**: For coloring (household or ~$2-$5).  
- **Printer and Paper**: To print the worksheet (household or library access).  
- **Optional**: Pencil for labeling; ruler for neatness.  
- **Accessibility**: Free with printer access; hand-drawn alternative if no printer.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Prepare the Worksheet (Pre-Lesson, 10-15 Minutes)**:
   - Print the reusable map (`resources/map_of_guatemala.pdf`) or download a blank Central America map online.
   - Add these instructions to the page (write or type):
     - “Color Guatemala in your favorite color (e.g., green).”
     - “Write ‘Guatemala’ inside the colored area.”
     - “Optional: Label Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.”
   - Alternatively, use the map with a separate instruction sheet if combining manually.
2. **Introduce the Activity (Lesson 1, 5 Minutes)**:
   - Say, “Today, we’ll find Guatemala on a map. It’s where we live and where the Maya were!”
   - Show the map and point to Guatemala’s location.
3. **Complete the Worksheet (Lesson 1, 15 Minutes)**:
   - Guide the student to color Guatemala (e.g., “Let’s make it green!”).
   - Help them write “Guatemala” inside the outline (spell aloud if needed).
   - For advanced learners, label neighbors (e.g., “Mexico is above Guatemala”).
4. **Review (Lesson 1, 5 Minutes)**:
   - Ask, “Where is Guatemala on your map?” to prompt narration.
   - Add the worksheet to the portfolio.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: During Lesson 1 (15 minutes), the student colors and labels Guatemala on the map worksheet, reinforcing geography.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe accuracy in coloring/labeling; ask, “What countries are next to Guatemala?” during narration.
- **Summative Assessment**: Portfolio inclusion shows geographical awareness; Week 10 review checks retention.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label all neighboring countries or add Guatemala City with a star.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-color Guatemala or use a pre-labeled map; focus on coloring only.
- **Visual Learners**: Use bright colors and point out borders physically.

## Time Estimates
- Pre-Lesson Prep: 10-15 minutes (printing and adding instructions).
- Activity in Lesson: 15 minutes (part of Lesson 1).
- Review: 5 minutes (within Lesson 1).

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring and writing skills (with help).
- **Parent**: Ability to print or draw the map and add instructions.

## Parental Involvement
- Print or prepare the worksheet before Lesson 1.
- Guide the student during the activity, assisting with labeling if needed.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map; use high-contrast crayons.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label or use stickers for “Guatemala.”
- **Language Support**: Say and write “Guatemala” in English and Spanish.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes printer access; if unavailable, hand-draw the map using a reference.
- Relies on the reusable map; a downloaded alternative works if needed.
