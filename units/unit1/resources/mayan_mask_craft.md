# Mayan Mask Craft

## Overview
This resource provides instructions for a hands-on craft activity to create a Mayan-inspired mask, used in Unit 1, Lesson 2: Daily Life of the Maya. The activity connects students to Maya culture, where masks were used in ceremonies and to honor gods or ancestors, fostering creativity and historical understanding. Designed for a 7-year-old, it uses simple materials and aligns with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on hands-on learning.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not Common Core State Standards. The craft supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical learning through a tangible representation of Maya culture.
- Enhancing fine motor skills and creativity via art integration.
- Encouraging narration as students describe their mask’s purpose.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this craft, the student will be able to:
1. Identify masks as an important element of Maya ceremonies and culture.
2. Create a Mayan-inspired mask using paper plates and markers.
3. Describe the mask’s imagined purpose (e.g., for a god or warrior) during narration.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Paper Plate**: One per mask (standard white, household item).
- **Markers or Crayons**: Various colors (household or purchased, ~$2-$5).
- **Scissors**: For cutting eye holes (household item; adult supervision required).
- **Optional**: String or elastic band (to wear the mask, ~$1-$2), hole punch (household or ~$5).
- **Optional Visuals**: Pictures of Mayan masks (print from online sources or use a book).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost, common materials; substitutes (e.g., pencils for markers) work if needed.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Gather Materials (Pre-Lesson, 5-10 Minutes)**:
   - Collect a paper plate, markers/crayons, scissors, and optional items (string, hole punch).
   - Optionally, print or find images of Mayan masks for inspiration.
2. **Introduce the Craft (Lesson 2, 5 Minutes)**:
   - Explain, “The Maya made masks for special events. Today, we’ll make our own!”
   - Show pictures (if available) and discuss features (e.g., big eyes, colorful patterns).
3. **Create the Mask (Lesson 2, 20 Minutes)**:
   - **Step 1: Prepare the Base**: Use the paper plate as the mask’s face.
   - **Step 2: Design**: Draw a face with markers/crayons (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth, patterns like feathers or jewels).
   - **Step 3: Cut Eye Holes**: With adult help, cut two small holes for eyes (test visibility).
   - **Step 4: Add Details**: Draw extra features (e.g., headdress, borders).
   - **Step 5 (Optional)**: Punch holes on sides and tie string/elastic to wear the mask.
4. **Discuss and Display (Lesson 2, 5 Minutes)**:
   - Ask, “Who might wear your mask? A god or a warrior?” to prompt narration.
   - Display the mask or use it in play.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: During Lesson 2 (20 minutes), the student makes the mask, guided by the parent, exploring Maya culture through art.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe effort and creativity during crafting; ask, “What’s your mask for?” to check understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the mask for the portfolio; assess narration in Lesson 2 for cultural connection (e.g., mentions ceremonies).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add complex patterns or research a specific Maya mask design.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-draw a basic face outline; focus on coloring.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Encourage wearing the mask and acting out a scene.

## Time Estimates
- Pre-Lesson Prep: 5-10 minutes.
- Crafting in Lesson: 20 minutes (part of Lesson 2).
- Discussion: 5 minutes (within Lesson 2).

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring skills; cutting with adult help.
- **Parent**: Ability to supervise cutting and guide the activity.

## Parental Involvement
- Gather materials before Lesson 2.
- Assist with cutting and facilitate the craft, prompting discussion about the mask’s purpose.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use bold markers and large plates for visibility.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut eye holes or use stickers for decoration.
- **Attention Span**: Break into two 10-minute segments (design, then cut/decorate).

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic craft supplies; substitutes (e.g., paper for plates) are viable.
- Requires adult supervision for scissors; if unavailable, skip cutting and draw eyes.
