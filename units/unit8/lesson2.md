# Unit 8, Lesson 2: Practicing Interview Skills with Señora Mayarí de León

## Overview
This lesson builds on Unit 8, Lesson 1 by helping a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student develop and practice interview skills for their upcoming visit to Casa Museo Luis de Lión. Using the questions prepared in the previous lesson, the student will practice proper interview techniques through role-play activities, learning about respectful communication, active listening, and appropriate follow-up questions. This preparation will enhance the quality of their interview with Señora Mayarí de León about her father's life and legacy. Aligned with Charlotte Mason's educational philosophy, the lesson incorporates oral narration, real-world application, and respectful interpersonal skills.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Narration**: Encourages the student to articulate questions and responses clearly during role-play activities.
- **Short Lessons**: Divides practice into manageable segments focused on different interviewing skills.
- **Real-World Application**: Prepares the student for an authentic interaction with a primary historical source.
- **Respectful Relationships**: Emphasizes courtesy, gratitude, and active listening when speaking with others.
- **Oral Language Development**: Builds speaking skills through practice of clear articulation and thoughtful responses.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand the importance of respectful communication and active listening in an interview setting.
2. Practice articulating clear and thoughtful questions and responses during role-play activities.
3. Develop skills for engaging in a respectful conversation with a primary historical source.
4. Demonstrate appropriate body language and non-verbal communication during an interview.
5. Show appreciation and gratitude when someone shares personal memories and stories.

## Time Required
45-50 minutes

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce the importance of interview skills and revisit the prepared questions.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Begin by saying: "Today, we'll practice for our interview with Señora Mayarí. Let's practice asking our questions and being good listeners."
     - Review the questions from the special notebook: "Let's look at the questions we created last time."
     - Explain what makes a good interviewer: "Good interviewers speak clearly, listen carefully, and show they care about what the person is saying."

2. **Posture and Speaking Practice (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Develop appropriate body language and speaking skills for the interview.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Practice sitting properly: "When we interview someone, we sit up straight to show we're paying attention."
     - Practice eye contact (in a culturally appropriate way): "We look at the person when they're speaking, but not staring, to show we're listening."
     - Practice speaking clearly: Have the student say each question clearly and at an appropriate volume.
     - Give feedback: "That was great! I could hear you very well. Try to speak a little slower next time."

3. **Interview Role-Play (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Practice the full interview process through role-playing.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Set up the role-play: You pretend to be Señora Mayarí while the student practices being the interviewer.
     - Guide the student through the proper greeting: "Start by saying 'Thank you for meeting with me today, Señora Mayarí.'"
     - Have the student ask their prepared questions while you give simple responses.
     - Model how to show interest: "When I share something, you can nod or say 'That's interesting' to show you're listening."
     - Practice following up: "If I say something interesting, you can ask another question about it."
     - If available, record this practice session (audio only) to listen back together.

4. **Active Listening Practice (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Develop active listening skills for the interview.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Explain active listening: "Active listening means showing you understand what someone is saying."
     - Practice with some responses: "When Señora Mayarí answers, you might say 'So your father liked to write poems?' to show you're listening."
     - Try a simple exercise: Tell a brief story about Luis de Lión and have the student summarize what they heard.
     - Practice appropriate reactions: "When Señora Mayarí shares a happy memory, you can smile. If it's a sad memory, you can look thoughtful."

5. **Thank You Note Preparation (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Prepare a thank you note template for after the interview.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Explain the importance of saying thank you: "After someone shares their stories, we say thank you to show we appreciate their time."
     - Create a simple thank you note template that can be personalized after the interview.
     - Practice what to say at the end of the interview: "Thank you very much for sharing your memories about your father with me."

6. **Wrap-Up and Field Trip Preview (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Review skills learned and preview the upcoming field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Summarize the key interview skills learned: "Today you practiced asking questions clearly, listening carefully, and showing respect."
     - Preview the field trip: "In a few days, we'll visit Casa Museo Luis de Lión and meet Señora Mayarí. You'll be well prepared to interview her."
     - End with encouragement: "You're going to be a wonderful interviewer! Señora Mayarí will appreciate your thoughtful questions."

## Activities and Assessments
- **Formative Assessment**: 
  - Observe the student's body language, speaking clarity, and listening skills during role-play
  - Note how well the student incorporates feedback to improve their interview technique
  - Check for appropriate follow-up questions during the role-play scenarios
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Evaluate the quality of the thank you note template
  - At the field trip, observe how effectively the student applies the practiced skills
- **Extension Activities**:
  - Create a simple "interview guide" with tips and reminders to use during the real interview
  - Practice with a family member as an additional interviewee

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage development of complex follow-up questions; ask the student to think about potential challenges in the interview and how to address them
- **Struggling Learners**: Provide simpler question scripts; focus on 2-3 main interview skills rather than all aspects at once; offer more modeling and guided practice
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Incorporate movement into the role-play (e.g., passing a "microphone" back and forth); allow standing during practice
- **Visual Learners**: Create visual cue cards for interview steps; draw simple diagrams showing good listening posture

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Posture and Speaking Practice: 10 minutes
- Interview Role-Play: 15 minutes
- Active Listening Practice: 10 minutes
- Thank You Note Preparation: 5 minutes
