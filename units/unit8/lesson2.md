### Overview
This lesson explores the historical significance of the San Juan del Obispo Church for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student, as part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through discussion, an outdoor walk, and crafting a paper church model, the student will learn about the church’s role in local history, building on Lesson 1’s introduction. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, short lessons, and hands-on activities—it connects the student to their community’s heritage near Antigua, Guatemala, enhancing engagement with a nature-based observation.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling of the church’s story, enhancing comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits discussion to 10 minutes, outdoor walk to 5-10 minutes, and crafting to 15 minutes to maintain focus.
- **Hands-On**: Uses crafting and an outdoor walk for kinesthetic engagement, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on nature and practical activities.
- **Nature Study**: Incorporates an outdoor walk to observe the church’s surroundings, fostering a connection to the environment as per Charlotte Mason’s principles.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand the San Juan del Obispo Church’s importance in the town’s history, founded by Bishop Marroquín.
2. Observe and describe features of the church’s surroundings (e.g., architecture, gardens).
3. Create a paper model of the church to visualize its design.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Craft Supplies**: Construction paper (white/light color for church, red/brown for roof, other colors for details), scissors (household; adult supervision required), glue or tape (household or ~$1), markers or crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Craft Instructions**: From `units/unit8/resources/church_craft.md` (provided in curriculum).
- **Outdoor Space**: Area around the San Juan del Obispo Church or a similar local building (accessible by short walk for residents).
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of the San Juan del Obispo Church (e.g., search “San Juan del Obispo church” online; free printable resources).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost, common materials; substitutes (e.g., plain paper, pencils) viable; outdoor space assumed accessible for San Juan residents.

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce the church and its historical role.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: “Bishop Marroquín started our town. Today, we’ll learn about his church!”
     - Say, “The church is old and special. We’ll talk about it, see it outside, and make one!”
     - Show optional images and ask, “What do you like about our church?”
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the church through discussion, outdoor observation, and crafting.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Discussion (10 minutes)**: Talk about the church’s history: “Bishop Marroquín built it long ago for praying and teaching.” Use images if available. Ask, “What do you see when we pass the church?”
     - **Outdoor Church Walk (5-10 minutes)**: Take a short walk to the church (or a nearby building if inaccessible). Say, “Let’s look at the church’s outside!” Point out features (e.g., bell tower, windows, gardens). Ask, “What do you notice? How might it have looked long ago?” Supervise closely for safety.
     - **Craft (15 minutes)**: Return indoors. Provide materials and follow the craft guide: Cut and fold a church base (6x4 inches), add a roof (4x2 inches) and bell tower (2x2 inches), decorate with markers. Say, “Let’s make it look like our church with a tower!”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about your church” or “What did you see outside?”
     - Encourage details (e.g., “It has a big tower”). Note a key idea (e.g., “The church is old”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The church is a big part of San Juan’s history, and we saw it today.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll visit it again to learn more!”
     - Add a church craft drawing to the timeline’s Local History section.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Discussion (10 minutes)**: Talking about the church’s history and features.
  - **Outdoor Church Walk (5-10 minutes)**: Observing the church’s surroundings to connect to its history.
  - **Crafting (15 minutes)**: Making a paper church model to visualize its design.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Discussion**: Listen for understanding (e.g., mentions bishop or purpose) to assess comprehension.
  - **Outdoor Walk**: Check observations (e.g., “The tower is tall”) to gauge engagement with the environment.
  - **Craft**: Observe effort and connection to the church (e.g., adds windows) to evaluate creativity.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the craft for the portfolio, assessing participation and comprehension informally (no rubric; based on effort and connection to the church).
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 8 connection to evaluate long-term retention.

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add more craft details (e.g., stained glass) or narrate extra facts (e.g., “It helped sick people”); describe additional outdoor features (e.g., garden plants).
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut craft pieces; simplify narration to “What’s your church for?”; shorten outdoor walk to 5 minutes with one focus (e.g., tower).
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Use the craft as a prop while narrating (e.g., point to tower); walk around during outdoor observation.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to inspire craft decoration; emphasize visual details during the walk (e.g., colors).

### Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min discussion, 5-10 min outdoor walk, 15 min craft)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50-55 minutes (adjustable to 45 minutes by limiting outdoor walk to 5 minutes)

### Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting and gluing skills (with adult help); familiarity with San Juan del Obispo’s history from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to facilitate discussion, supervise outdoor activity, and assist with craft; no historical expertise required.

### Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Gather craft supplies as per `units/unit8/resources/church_craft.md` and ensure access to the church or a similar site (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Lead the discussion, supervise the outdoor walk (ensuring safety), help with cutting and assembling the craft, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What do you see when we go to the church?” or “How does it look different from our house?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the craft in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student.

### Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use high-contrast colors for the craft (e.g., dark roof, light walls); describe outdoor features aloud (e.g., “The tower is tall and white”); enlarge images if used.
- **Auditory Needs**: Speak clearly during discussion; repeat outdoor observations (e.g., “The windows are big”); allow extra time for narration responses.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut craft pieces; assist with gluing or drawing; simplify outdoor walk to pointing from a stationary spot if mobility is limited.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten discussion to 7 minutes or outdoor walk to 5 minutes with a brief break; adjust craft time as needed.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “torre/tower”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in Spanish if preferred.

### Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes the student lives in San Juan del Obispo with walking access to the church; if unavailable, use a nearby building or photos as an alternative.
- Assumes access to basic craft supplies; plain paper and pencils can substitute if construction paper or markers are lacking.
- Assumes weather permits a short outdoor walk; if not, use indoor photos or drawings of the church’s exterior as a substitute.
- Relies on Lesson 1’s introduction; recap Bishop Marroquín’s role briefly (“He built our town and church”) if missed.
