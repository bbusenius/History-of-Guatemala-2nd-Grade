# The Bishop's Town

Long ago, in the beautiful land of Guatemala, there was a kind and wise man named Bishop Francisco Marroquín. He was the first bishop of Guatemala and loved helping people.

One day, Bishop Marroquín decided to build a special place where he could live and teach. He chose a spot near the city of Antigua, surrounded by green hills and fresh air. This place became known as San Juan del Obispo, named after Saint John the Bishop.

Bishop Marroquín built a big church with tall bell towers and colorful windows. He also planted gardens with flowers and fruit trees. People from all around came to visit and learn from him.

In San Juan del Obispo, the bishop taught children to read and write. He also helped the sick and gave food to those who were hungry. The town grew, and soon there were houses, shops, and even a school.

Today, San Juan del Obispo is still a peaceful town with its historic church and friendly people. When you visit, you can see the church that Bishop Marroquín built and imagine what life was like long ago.
