# Field Trip Plan: Unit 8 - Visit to Casa Museo Luis de Lión

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. Following Unit 7 and Unit 8's lessons on 20th century Guatemala, the civil war, and Luis de Lión, this visit to Casa Museo Luis de Lión in San Juan del Obispo will allow the student to interview Señora Mayarí de León, Luis de Lión's daughter. This creates a powerful personal connection to history by meeting someone directly affected by the events studied. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired approaches of firsthand experience and narration, this 1-2 hour visit leverages the student's proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring preparation of thoughtful interview questions.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason's philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:

- Developing active listening and respectful communication skills through the interview process.
- Creating meaningful emotional connections to history by meeting someone personally affected by historical events.
- Promoting cultural appreciation by visiting a local museum dedicated to preserving Guatemalan literary heritage.
