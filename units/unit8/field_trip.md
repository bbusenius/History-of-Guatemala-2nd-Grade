# Field Trip Plan: Unit 8 - San Juan del Obispo Church

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the local history of San Juan del Obispo by visiting the San Juan del Obispo Church, connecting Lessons 1 and 2 to a real-world site. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration, this optional 2-3 hour trip leverages the student’s residence in San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards per the course rules. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of a local colonial landmark, aligning with the curriculum’s focus on San Juan del Obispo (Weeks 8-9).
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason emphasis.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to the student’s local heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Observe key features of the San Juan del Obispo Church (e.g., bell tower, windows).
2. Connect the visit to Lessons 1-2 about the town’s history and the church’s role.
3. Sketch one church feature to demonstrate engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Field Trip Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing and shoes; transportation minimal if walking (local site).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or plain paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera or smartphone for photos (to aid narration).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; church entry is typically free; walking distance for San Juan del Obispo residents.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (15 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe and educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “We’re visiting our church to see what we learned about!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a small bag.
     - Plan a short walk to the church (verify accessibility if driving).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive; point out features: “Look at the big tower!”
     - Say, “Bishop Marroquín built this long ago. Let’s draw something you see.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site and complete the sketching activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Explore the exterior (e.g., facade, tower) and interior if open (e.g., altars).
     - Ask, “What do you think this part is for?” (e.g., “The tower has bells”).
     - Sketch one feature (e.g., window) in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines.
     - Allow free observation if time permits.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect briefly and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch: “What did you draw?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn about our church?” and return home.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one church feature (e.g., door, bell tower) in 15-20 minutes, noting its possible use (e.g., “For ringing bells”).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement during sketching; listen to initial reflections to gauge understanding.
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the sketch for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess recall and connection to lessons informally (no rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple features or add a short description (e.g., “This is old”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw a basic shape (e.g., square for tower); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to features while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos taken on-site to reinforce observations.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 15 minutes
- Arrival and Orientation: 10 minutes
- Exploration and Activity: 1-2 hours
- Wrap-Up and Departure: 15 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (flexible based on parent’s schedule)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic observation and drawing skills; familiarity with Unit 8 lessons.
- **Parent**: Ability to plan a short trip; basic facilitation skills (e.g., guiding observation).

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Pack materials and plan the walk (~15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Accompany the student, guide exploration, and assist with sketching.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing, “What do you think people did here long ago?”
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct the post-trip discussion at home and store the sketch in the portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe features aloud (e.g., “The tower is tall”); use a magnifying glass if needed.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with sketching (e.g., trace outlines) or use a camera instead.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten the visit to 1 hour or take a snack break midway.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “torre/tower”) to reinforce learning.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes the student lives in San Juan del Obispo with walking access; adjust logistics if further (e.g., bus to Antigua adds ~15-30 minutes).
- Assumes church accessibility; verify hours if planning a specific time.
- Weather may affect outdoor observation; virtual alternative mitigates this.
