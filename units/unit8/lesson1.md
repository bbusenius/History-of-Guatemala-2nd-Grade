# Unit 8, Lesson 1: Preparing Interview Questions for Señora Mayarí de León

## Overview
This lesson prepares a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to conduct an interview with Señora Mayarí de León, the daughter of Luis de Lión, as part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Building on Unit 7's introduction to Luis de Lión's life and work, this lesson focuses on developing thoughtful, age-appropriate interview questions about his life, teaching career, literary works, and legacy. Through brainstorming, guided writing, and categorization activities, the student will learn the basics of conducting a respectful and meaningful interview. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, and authentic learning experiences—this lesson prepares the student for a personal connection with history through firsthand testimony.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Builds on prior readings about Luis de Lión's life and work, using primary sources to create meaningful connections.
- **Narration**: Encourages the student to articulate what they've learned about Luis de Lión through question formation.
- **Short Lessons**: Divides the interview preparation into manageable segments, focusing on different question categories.
- **Authentic Learning**: Prepares for a real-world interaction with a primary historical source (Señora Mayarí).
- **Writing Practice**: Develops writing skills through crafting clear, concise questions.
- **Respectful Relationships**: Emphasizes respect and empathy when discussing potentially sensitive historical topics.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Develop thoughtful, age-appropriate interview questions about Luis de Lión's life, teaching career, literary works, and legacy.
2. Categorize questions into different areas of inquiry (e.g., personal life, teaching, writing).
3. Write clear, concise questions that demonstrate respect and empathy.
4. Prepare for a respectful and meaningful interview with Señora Mayarí de León.
5. Understand the importance of listening and showing appreciation when someone shares personal memories.

## Time Required
45-50 minutes

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce the concept of an interview and its purpose.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Begin by saying: "This week, we will visit Casa Museo Luis de Lión and meet Señora Mayarí, Luis de Lión's daughter. Today we'll prepare questions to ask her about her father."
     - Discuss what an interview is: "An interview is when we ask someone questions to learn from their experiences."
     - **Emphasize respectful listening**: "When someone shares their memories, we listen carefully and say thank you because they're giving us a special gift—their stories."

2. **Review and Remember (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Recall key facts about Luis de Lión to inform question development.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the Luis de Lión article from Unit 7: "Let's remember what we learned about Luis de Lión."
     - Ask guided recall questions: "What did he do for work? What did he write? What happened to him during the civil war?"
     - Have the student narrate 2-3 facts they remember about Luis de Lión.
     - Create a simple mind map on paper with "Luis de Lión" in the center and the student's recalled facts around it.

3. **Question Brainstorming (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Generate potential interview questions across categories.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Introduce the question categories laid out on the table: "We'll think of questions in four different areas."
     - Model with an example for each category:
       - Childhood/Family: "What was your father like at home?"
       - Teaching: "What subjects did your father like to teach?"
       - Writing: "Did your father read his poems to you?"
       - Museum/Memory: "How did you decide to create a museum for your father?"
     - For each category, help the student brainstorm 2-3 questions, writing each on a separate index card.
     - Guide the student to keep questions simple, respectful, and open-ended.
     - Place each question card in the appropriate category.

4. **Question Selection and Refinement (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Select and improve final interview questions.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review all question cards and select 5-7 best questions total (at least one from each category).
     - Help the student refine selected questions for clarity: "Let's make sure our questions are clear and easy to understand."
     - Discuss why some questions might be better than others: "This question helps us learn something new" or "This question is respectful of Señora Mayarí's feelings."
     - Copy the final questions into the special interview notebook in neat handwriting.

5. **Wrap-Up and Preview (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize learning and prepare for next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the final questions together: "These are excellent questions to ask Señora Mayarí. You've prepared well for our interview."
     - Preview the next lesson: "In our next lesson, we'll practice asking these questions and learn more about being a good interviewer."
     - End with appreciation: "Thank you for creating such thoughtful questions. I know Señora Mayarí will appreciate your interest in her father's story."

## Activities and Assessments
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe the student's ability to generate relevant questions and categorize them appropriately.
- **Summative Assessment**: Review the final selected questions for clarity, respect, and relevance to Luis de Lión's life and legacy.
- **Extension Activity**: Have the student illustrate one or two questions with simple drawings to help remember what they want to ask.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate additional story details (e.g., “He helped people”); write an extra question.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to “Who was Luis de Lión?”; allow tracing for writing questions.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Use gestures while narrating or hold the interview notebook while brainstorming.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images or emphasize the importance of clear handwriting in the interview notebook.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min storytelling, 5 min picture study, 5 min dictation, 10 min mapping)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include picture study without reducing other activities)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, coloring, and writing skills; familiarity with colonial history from Units 3-4.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, source an online image, and assist with map labeling; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Prepare the map as per `units/unit8/resources/san_juan_map.md`, print or load the story, and source the painting image online (~10-15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the story, present the picture study, dictate the sentence, guide mapping, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What’s your favorite part of our town?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and map in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student’s sketch.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map, story text, and painting image; describe visuals aloud (e.g., “The painting has green hills”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label the map or assist with coloring; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Attention Span**: Split storytelling and mapping into two 12-minute segments with a movement break.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “obispo/bishop”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes ability to draw or source a simple map; a basic hand-drawn sketch works if no printer available.
- Assumes internet access for the painting image; an offline alternative is a parent-drawn sketch of a colonial town if unavailable.
- Assumes student lives in San Juan del Obispo; adapt for other locations by emphasizing proximity to Antigua.
- Relies on prior colonial units; recap Spanish arrival briefly (“The Spanish came long ago”) if needed.
