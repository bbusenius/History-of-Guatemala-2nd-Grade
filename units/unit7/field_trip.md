## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on modern Guatemalan culture and traditions by visiting an artisan workshop in Antigua, such as the Casa del Tejido Antiguo, where traditional textiles are made. The trip connects Lessons 1 and 2 (contemporary culture and festivals) to real-world craftsmanship, using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration. Designed as an optional 2-3 hour outing, it leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing cultural understanding through observation of traditional crafts.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemalan artisan traditions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Observe the process of making traditional Guatemalan textiles or crafts.
2. Connect the workshop to Lessons 1-2 about modern culture and traditions.
3. Sketch one item or scene from the workshop to demonstrate engagement.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos, magnifying glass for details (household).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for an educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “We’re visiting a place where they make traditional Guatemalan clothes!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a bag.
     - Choose a workshop (e.g., Casa del Tejido Antiguo) and plan transportation.
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize with the workshop.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive; say, “Look at the colorful fabrics!”
     - Set goal: “Let’s watch how they make things and draw one.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Observe and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Watch artisans weaving or dyeing; note tools and techniques.
     - Ask, “How do they make the colors?” or “What patterns do you see?”
     - Sketch one item (e.g., loom, fabric) in 15-20 minutes.
     - Explore exhibits if time permits.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review sketch: “What did you draw?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn about Guatemalan crafts?” and depart.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one workshop item/scene (e.g., loom) in 15-20 minutes, noting its use.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to reflections (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect sketch for portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess connections informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple items or add notes (e.g., “This is for weaving”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw simple shapes (e.g., a square for a loom); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to tools while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or a magnifying glass for detail focus.
