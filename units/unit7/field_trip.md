# Field Trip Plan: Unit 7 - Visit to Proyecto Luis de Líon Library

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum exploring Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the cultural legacy of Luis de Líon, a significant Guatemalan writer and educator, providing a hands-on opportunity to connect classroom learning with real-world experiences in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. The trip incorporates Charlotte Mason-inspired methods, such as observation and narration, to engage the student in a meaningful and memorable way. Designed to be flexible and requiring minimal preparation, this 2-3 hour field trip enhances the student's understanding of Guatemalan literature, culture, and the importance of community libraries, all within their own village of San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements, emphasizing flexible, child-centered learning inspired by Charlotte Mason's philosophy. It does not follow Common Core State Standards, as specified. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing understanding of Guatemala's literary history through direct engagement with a historic library.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussions about the importance of libraries and reading.
- Integrating cross-curricular elements (literature, history, community service) to meet broad homeschool learning objectives.
- Promoting cultural appreciation, connecting the student to their local heritage through the work of Luis de Líon.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify the significance of Luis de Líon and his contribution to Guatemalan literature and education.
2. Explain the importance of community libraries in making books accessible to everyone.
3. Connect the library experience to what they've learned about Luis de Líon's life and work.
4. Learn how the libary was started by Luis de Líon and how he had to run it in secret and hide it from the government. Learn how he burried books in plastic bags and planted corn on top to hide them. Learn how at a time, the library location was moved to a different house in the community every night.
