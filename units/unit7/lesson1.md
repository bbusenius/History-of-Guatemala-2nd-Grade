# Lesson Plan: Unit 7, Lesson 1 - Luis de Lión: A Voice Silenced During the Civil War

## Overview
This lesson introduces the life and legacy of Luis de Lión, a Kaqchikel Maya writer and teacher who was forcibly disappeared during Guatemala's civil war. Following the previous lesson on the civil war, this session provides a personal narrative that helps a 7-year-old student understand the human impact of historical events. Through age-appropriate reading and discussion of the ["Luis de Lión: A Brave Teacher and Writer"](resources/luis_de_lion.md) resource and exploration of his poem ["Acerca de la ternura"](resources/luis_de_lion_poem.md), the student will learn about Luis's contributions to education and literature, as well as the consequences of political conflict. This lesson uses Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, guided reading, reflection, and copywork—to engage the student in San Juan del Obispo, where Luis de Lión was born, creating a meaningful local connection to history.

## Notes for Parent/Teacher
- This lesson deals with a sensitive topic (forced disappearance) but presents it in an age-appropriate way. The focus is on Luis de Lión's positive contributions and legacy rather than the details of his disappearance.
- The local connection to San Juan del Obispo makes this lesson especially relevant, as the student can physically visit places connected to Luis de Lión's life.
- If the student shows particular interest in Luis de Lión's work as a teacher or writer, consider exploring additional Guatemalan literature in future lessons.
- This lesson builds directly on the previous lesson about Guatemala's civil war, helping to personalize a large historical event through one individual's story.
