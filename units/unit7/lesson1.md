# Lesson Plan: Unit 7, Lesson 1 - Contemporary Guatemalan Culture

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to modern Guatemalan culture through a child’s daily life within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through storytelling with a living book excerpt, a dictation exercise, and a drawing activity, the student compares their routine to a Guatemalan peer’s. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, and hands-on activities—it’s tailored for San Juan del Obispo, connecting contemporary culture to the student’s experience and building on Unit 6’s modernization focus.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses an excerpt from *Mayan Folktales* or *Cuentos y Leyendas de Guatemala*, replacing custom stories with narrative-driven texts to engage the student.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling to 10 minutes and dictation to 5 minutes for focus.
- **Hands-On**: Includes a drawing activity to foster comparison and creativity.
- **Dictation**: Incorporates a dictation exercise to practice spelling and reinforce cultural content, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s method of connecting writing to meaningful material.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe two aspects of modern Guatemalan life from the story (e.g., school, family).
2. Compare their routine to the story’s through drawing and narration.
3. Write a dictated sentence about modern culture with correct spelling.
4. Retell elements of the story in their own words.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Living Book**: A 5-10 minute excerpt from:
  - *Mayan Folktales: Folklore from Lake Atitlán, Guatemala* translated by James D. Sexton (English, ebook on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Mayan-Folktales-Folklore-Atitlán-Guatemala-ebook/dp/B00B9I2H0I), ~$9).
  - *Cuentos y Leyendas de Guatemala* by Francisco Barnoya Gálvez (Spanish, physical book via [Piedra Santa](https://www.piedrasanta.com/libro/cuentos-y-leyendas-de-guatemala_1607), ~$10-$15).
  - Sourcing details in `overview/parent_guide.md`.
- **Dictation Sentence**: "People in Guatemala go to school." (English) or "La gente en Guatemala va a la escuela." (Spanish), reflecting modern life from the story context.
- **Drawing Supplies**: Paper (standard 8.5x11, household item), crayons or markers (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation exercise (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of modern Guatemalan life (e.g., search “Antigua Guatemala daily life” online; free printable resources).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Ebook for *Mayan Folktales* prioritizes access; physical book may need local sourcing; drawing supplies are household items.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce contemporary culture and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 6: “Guatemala got modern. Today, we’ll see what life is like now!”
     - Say, “We’ll hear a story about a kid like you, write about it, and draw your day!”
     - Ask, “What do you do every day?” to set the stage.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore modern life through story, dictation, and drawing.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read a 5-10 minute excerpt from *Mayan Folktales* (e.g., a modern tale) or *Cuentos y Leyendas de Guatemala* (e.g., a contemporary story). Show optional images. Ask, “What’s similar to your day?”
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce cultural content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence about life in Guatemala today.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "People in Guatemala go to school." (English) or "La gente en Guatemala va a la escuela." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “You wrote ‘school’ perfectly!”).
     - **Drawing (15 minutes)**: Provide paper and crayons. Say, “Draw your day and something from the story, like going to school.” Guide them to compare routines.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “How’s your day like the story’s?” or “What did you draw?”
     - Encourage comparisons (e.g., “I go to school too”). Note a key similarity (e.g., “Kids go to school”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Kids in Guatemala have routines like ours, with special traditions.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn about festivals in our town!”
     - Add a drawing to the timeline’s Modern section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to a modern Guatemalan story to explore daily life (10 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to the story (5 minutes).
  - **Drawing**: Create a scene comparing their routine to the story’s (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., school, family) to assess comprehension.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “school” or “escuela”).
  - **Drawing**: Observe inclusion of story elements to gauge engagement and comparison skills.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and drawing for the portfolio, assessing participation and cultural understanding informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 7 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Draw a detailed scene with labels or narrate more similarities; write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify drawing to one element (e.g., school); shorten narration to “What do they do?”; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out a routine (e.g., walking to school) while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to inspire drawing and reinforce story concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min story, 5 min dictation, 15 min drawing)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include dictation without reducing other sections)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, drawing, and writing skills; Unit 6’s modern Guatemala context.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, assist with drawing, and conduct dictation; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Source the living book excerpt (e.g., download ebook) and gather drawing supplies (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the excerpt, dictate the sentence clearly, guide drawing, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Discuss, “What’s your favorite part of your day?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and drawing in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge text or use bold crayons; describe images aloud if used.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with drawing or provide a pre-drawn outline; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes or drawing to 10 minutes with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use “escuela/school” and “gente/people” bilingually; allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to a living book excerpt; parents can adapt a similar story if unavailable (see `overview/parent_guide.md`).
- Assumes drawing supplies; pencils substitute if crayons/markers lacking.
- Relies on Unit 6; recap modernization briefly if needed.
