# Unit 7, Lesson 2: Traditions and Festivals

## Overview
This lesson explores Guatemalan traditions and festivals, focusing on the Giant Kite Festival of Sumpango, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. Through storytelling, picture study, and crafting a paper kite, the student will learn how kites are used to honor loved ones during the Day of the Dead. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living stories, and hands-on activities—it fosters cultural appreciation and connects traditions to the student’s heritage near Antigua, building on Lesson 1’s cultural foundation.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses "The Giant Kite Festival" as a narrative-driven story to bring cultural traditions to life, per Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on engaging texts.
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments storytelling and picture study into concise blocks (e.g., 5-minute picture study) to maintain focus.
- **Picture Study**: Incorporates a 5-minute segment with a kite festival image to cultivate observation skills and cultural context, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s art appreciation approach.
- **Hands-On**: Crafting a kite provides kinesthetic engagement with festival traditions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe the Giant Kite Festival and its connection to the Day of the Dead.
2. Observe and narrate features of a festival kite image (e.g., colors, designs).
3. Create a paper kite to represent the festival’s symbolism.
4. Retell elements of the festival story or kite observations during narration.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "The Giant Kite Festival" (from `units/unit7/resources/the_giant_kite_festival.md`; print or read from a device).
- **Picture Study Image**: A high-quality image of a Giant Kite Festival kite from Sumpango, sourced online (e.g., search “Giant Kite Festival Sumpango Guatemala” on Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org, or cultural blogs like “Visit Guatemala,” ensuring free use or educational licensing). Alternatively, a photo from a Guatemalan tourism site or local archives.
- **Craft Supplies**: Construction paper (any color), scissors, glue or tape, string or yarn, markers or crayons (household or ~$5-$10 total).
- **Craft Instructions**: From `units/unit7/resources/paper_kite_craft.md` (provided in curriculum).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For noting narration observations if desired (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Additional festival images for reference (e.g., search “Day of the Dead Guatemala kites” online; free printable resources).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for optional addition.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; internet access needed for image sourcing, with offline alternatives provided (e.g., parent-drawn kite sketch).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce Guatemalan festivals and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: “We learned about life in Guatemala today. Now, we’ll explore a special celebration!”
     - Say, “The Giant Kite Festival uses big kites to remember people. Let’s hear about it and make one!”
     - Ask, “Have you ever flown a kite?” to spark curiosity.
2. **Main Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the festival through storytelling, picture study, and crafting.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "The Giant Kite Festival" aloud with enthusiasm. Show optional images if available. Pause to ask, “Why do they fly kites on this day?”
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the kite festival image. Say, “Look at this kite for 2 minutes. Notice the colors and designs.” After 2 minutes, cover the image and ask, “What did you see? What colors or shapes stood out?” Then, uncover it and discuss: “What do you think this kite is saying?”
     - **Crafting (10 minutes)**: Provide materials and follow the craft guide: Cut a diamond-shaped kite from construction paper, decorate with markers, attach tails and string. Say, “Make your kite special—who would you remember with it?”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the kite festival” or “What’s on your kite and why?”
     - Encourage details (e.g., “It’s for the Day of the Dead” or “My kite is blue”). Note a key idea (e.g., “Kites honor people”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The Giant Kite Festival is a way to celebrate and remember loved ones.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll visit a market to see more of our town!”
     - Add a kite sketch to the timeline’s Modern section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "The Giant Kite Festival" to understand the tradition (10 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss a kite image to appreciate festival art (5 minutes).
  - **Crafting**: Create a paper kite to engage with festival symbolism (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Check narration for festival details (e.g., kites, Day of the Dead) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “It’s colorful”) for memory and detail.
  - **Crafting**: Observe effort and connection (e.g., decoration reflects remembrance) to gauge engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the kite for the portfolio, assessing participation and cultural understanding informally based on effort and relevance.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 7 connection, focusing on creativity and link to traditions (no formal rubric; based on engagement).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add a written message to the kite (e.g., “For Grandma”) or narrate additional festival facts (e.g., “They play music”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut the kite shape; simplify narration to “What’s the kite for?”
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Pretend to fly the kite while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use additional festival images or emphasize the picture study to inspire craft design.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 25 minutes (10 min storytelling, 5 min picture study, 10 min crafting)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting and drawing skills (with help); familiarity with contemporary culture from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, source an online image, and assist with craft; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the story and source a kite festival image online (~10-15 minutes); gather craft supplies as per `units/unit7/resources/paper_kite_craft.md`.
- **Facilitation**: Read the story, present the picture study, help with cutting and decorating, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What would you put on your kite?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the kite in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student’s sketch.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the story text and kite image; describe features aloud (e.g., “The kite is red with circles”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut the kite shape or assist with assembly; allow verbal narration without extensive crafting.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten storytelling to 7 minutes or crafting to 8 minutes with a short movement break.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “cometa/kite,” “festival/festival”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes internet access for sourcing the kite image; an offline alternative is a parent-drawn kite sketch if unavailable.
- Assumes craft supply access; substitutes (e.g., plain paper, pencils) work if construction paper or markers are lacking.
- Relies on Lesson 1’s cultural context; recap briefly (“We learned about life today”) if needed.
