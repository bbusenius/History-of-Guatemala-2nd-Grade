# Unit 7, Lesson 2: Luis de Lión - Poetry and Legacy

## Overview
This lesson explores the poetry and legacy of Luis de Lión, an important Guatemalan poet, writer, and educator from San Juan del Obispo. Within this 10-week homeschool curriculum for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student, we will read and appreciate two poems by Luis de Lión, followed by a visit to the Proyecto Luis de Lión where we'll observe poetry displayed on the building. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living poetry, and hands-on activities—this lesson fosters cultural appreciation and connects the student to a significant literary figure from their own community, building on the cultural foundation established in Lesson 1.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses original poems by Luis de Lión as authentic literary works that bring his voice to life.
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling and personal response to poems.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments poetry reading and observation into concise blocks to maintain focus.
- **Picture Study**: Incorporates observation of poetry displayed on the Proyecto Luis de Lión building.
- **Hands-On**: Copying a poem and creating accompanying sketches provides kinesthetic engagement with literature.

1. Listen to and appreciate two poems by Luis de Lión.
