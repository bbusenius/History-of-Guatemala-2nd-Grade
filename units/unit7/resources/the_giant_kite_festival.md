# The Giant Kite Festival

Every year on November 1st, in the town of Sumpango, Guatemala, there is a special festival called the Giant Kite Festival. It happens on the Day of the Dead, when people remember their loved ones who have passed away.

At the festival, people make huge kites, some as big as a house! These kites are made of colorful paper and bamboo sticks. They are decorated with beautiful designs and messages of peace and hope.

The kites are flown in the cemetery, and it’s believed that they help communicate with the spirits of the dead. It’s a way to honor and remember them.

Families gather to watch the kites soar into the sky, and there’s music, food, and dancing. It’s a joyful celebration of life and memory.
