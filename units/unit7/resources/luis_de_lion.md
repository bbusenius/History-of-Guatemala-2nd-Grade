# Luis de Lión: A Brave Teacher and Writer

Luis de Lión was a person from Guatemala who loved to write stories and poems and teach children. He was born in a small village called San Juan del Obispo, near a beautiful volcano called Agua, on August 19, 1939.

## Who Was Luis de Lión?

Luis de Lión's real name was José Luis de León Díaz. He was a Kaqchikel Maya person. The Maya people are the original people of Guatemala who have lived there for thousands of years.

Luis grew up in a family that didn't have much money, but they worked very hard. His mom sold vegetables at the market, and his dad played the marimba and made art.

## He Loved to Teach Children

Luis became a teacher because he wanted to help children learn. He worked in many different schools around Guatemala. He especially loved teaching children how to read and write their own stories and poems.

Luis believed that all children could be writers. He created special lessons to help his students make their own books. He said that children's stories should be creative and imaginative, not just stories with a lesson at the end.

## He Created a Library

Luis loved books so much that he started a library in his hometown in 1962. He wanted everyone to have books to read, even if they didn't have money to buy them. He shared his own books with others and taught adults in his village how to read using the Bible.

This library still exists today at Proyecto Luis de Lión in San Juan del Obispo. The project continues to maintain the library he founded and uses it especially to help children in the community learn to read and enjoy books.

## His Writing

Luis wrote many stories and poems. His most famous book is called "El tiempo principia en Xibalbá" (Time Begins in Xibalbá). Xibalbá is a place in Maya stories that is like an underworld. His stories often included Maya ideas and traditions.

## What Happened to Luis de Lión?

During Guatemala's civil war, the government fought against groups that opposed them, especially communist organizations. Luis was a member of the Guatemalan Workers' Party (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo or PGT), a communist political party. The government considered communists to be enemies of the state and a threat to national security.

The army and government targeted people they believed were supporting communism or opposing the government. This included members of political parties like the PGT, labor union leaders, student activists, and others who criticized the government. The government also target people just for being of Mayan descent even if they were not communists.

On May 15, 1984, Luis was walking on 2nd Avenue in Guatemala City at around 5:00 in the afternoon. Soldiers in plain clothes (not wearing uniforms) stopped him and forced him into a car. This is called a "forced disappearance," and it happened to many people during the war.

When Luis didn't come home that night, his family became very worried. They looked everywhere for him. They went to police stations, hospitals, and army buildings asking if anyone had seen Luis. The government officials told them they didn't know anything about Luis.

His students and fellow teachers also looked for him. They put his picture in newspapers and asked everyone they met if they had seen their beloved teacher. But no one could find any information about where Luis had been taken.

For 15 years, Luis's family didn't know what had happened to him. They always hoped he might come home someday. Then, in 1999, something important was discovered - a secret book called the "Military Diary" that had been kept by the army. This diary showed that Luis had been taken by soldiers on May 15, 1984, and that he had been killed on June 6, 1984, just three weeks after his disappearance.

## Remembering Luis de Lión

Today, many people remember Luis de Lión for his beautiful writing and his work as a teacher. There is a museum in his hometown called "Casa Museo Luis de Lión" where you can learn about his life and see his books. Sadly, his body has never been found, and his family continues to search for him.

Luis believed that children are "a blank page where you can begin to write a new history." His daughter, Mayarí de León, continues his legacy through the "Proyecto Luis de Lión," which includes:

- The Community Academy of Arts of San Juan del Obispo
- The José Luis de Lión Díaz Library
- The Luis de Lión Museum House

These initiatives serve children monthly through reading programs and arts education, continuing Luis's vision of fighting inequality, racism, and violence through education.

In 2004, the government of Guatemala said they were sorry for what happened to Luis de Lión. They gave him special honors to remember how important he was.

Luis de Lión's name is now on a street in his village, and there's even a special prize for writers named after him. His story helps us remember that it's important to speak up for what's right, even when it's difficult.
