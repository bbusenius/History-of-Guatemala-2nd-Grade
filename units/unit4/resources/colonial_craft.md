# Colonial Hat Craft

## Overview
This resource provides instructions for crafting a simple paper colonial hat, used in Unit 4, Lesson 2: Daily Life in Colonial Times. The tricorn-style hat reflects colonial fashion in Antigua, Guatemala, enhancing the student’s understanding of daily life through hands-on creativity. Designed for a 7-year-old, it aligns with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on art integration and requires minimal preparation.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not Common Core State Standards. The craft supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding of colonial life through a tangible item.
- Enhancing fine motor skills and creativity, aligning with cross-subject goals (art).
- Encouraging narration about colonial society, a Charlotte Mason focus.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this craft, the student will be able to:
1. Recognize hats as part of colonial attire in Antigua.
2. Create a paper tricorn hat using basic materials.
3. Describe the hat’s imagined wearer during narration (e.g., “A market seller”).

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Construction Paper**: Brown or black for authenticity (household or ~$5/pack).
- **Scissors**: For cutting (household; adult supervision required).
- **Glue or Tape**: To assemble (household or ~$1).
- **Markers**: For decoration (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional Reference**: Images of colonial hats (e.g., search “tricorn hat colonial” online; free).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost, common materials; substitutes (e.g., plain paper) viable.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (5 minutes, pre-lesson)**:
   - Gather construction paper, scissors, glue/tape, and markers.
   - Optionally, find images of tricorn hats online for inspiration.
2. **Introduction (5 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - Say, “People in colonial Antigua wore hats like this. Let’s make one!”
   - Show images if available.
3. **Craft Activity (10 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - **Step 1**: Cut a 2-inch-wide strip long enough to fit the student’s head.
   - **Step 2**: Cut a large circle (8-10 inches diameter) for the brim.
   - **Step 3**: Cut a smaller circle in the brim’s center, slightly larger than the strip.
   - **Step 4**: Form the strip into a cylinder, secure with glue/tape, then attach to the brim’s inner circle.
   - **Step 5**: Decorate with markers (e.g., feather, ribbon).
4. **Discussion (5 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - Ask, “Who might wear your hat?” to prompt narration.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Craft the hat during Lesson 2 (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe effort; check narration for colonial connection (e.g., “A Spanish man wears it”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Portfolio inclusion assesses participation.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add detailed decorations or narrate a wearer’s story.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut pieces; focus on assembly.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 5 minutes.
- Crafting: 10 minutes (within Lesson 2).

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting/gluing skills (with help).
- **Parent**: Ability to supervise scissors.

## Parental Involvement
- Gather materials.
- Assist with cutting and assembly.

## Accommodations
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut shapes; assist with taping.
- **Visual Needs**: Use bold colors; describe steps.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes supply access; substitutes work if needed.
- Requires adult help for scissors; simplify if unavailable.
