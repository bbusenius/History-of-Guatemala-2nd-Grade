# Colonial Antigua Map

## Overview
This resource provides instructions for sourcing or creating a simple map of colonial Antigua, Guatemala, used in Unit 4, Lesson 1: Colonial Architecture in Antigua. The map helps the student visualize key colonial buildings (e.g., cathedral, La Merced Church) and integrates geography with history. Designed for a 7-year-old, it supports hands-on learning and narration, aligning with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not Common Core State Standards. The map supports educational goals by:
- Integrating geography with historical understanding of colonial Antigua.
- Enhancing spatial awareness and fine motor skills through labeling or coloring.
- Encouraging narration about colonial architecture, a Charlotte Mason focus.

## Learning Objectives
By using this resource, the student will be able to:
1. Identify key colonial buildings in Antigua on a map (e.g., cathedral, La Merced Church).
2. Label or color the map to connect to Lesson 1’s architecture focus.
3. Describe the map’s features during narration, linking to colonial life.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Map Options**:
  - **Option 1: Online Search**: Search for "map of colonial Antigua Guatemala for kids" or "simple map of Antigua Guatemala" on educational websites or image searches (e.g., Google Images, free teacher resources). Look for a clear, outline map showing key buildings like the cathedral, La Merced Church, and central plaza.
  - **Option 2: Hand-Draw**: On a sheet of paper (8.5x11), sketch a simple grid of Antigua’s streets. Draw squares or rectangles for key buildings: the cathedral at the center, La Merced Church to the north, and the central plaza nearby. Label lightly for the student to trace or copy.
  - **Option 3: Tourist Map**: Use a simplified tourist map of Antigua from a local source (e.g., library, visitor center), highlighting colonial sites.
- **Crayons or Markers**: For coloring or labeling (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Pencil for light labeling; ruler for straight lines (household).
- **Accessibility**: Free with internet or drawing supplies; printer needed for online option.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (10-15 minutes, pre-lesson)**:
   - Choose an option: Search online, draw by hand, or source a tourist map.
   - If online, download and print a simple outline map. If drawing, sketch a basic layout (e.g., grid with 3-4 key buildings).
   - Ensure the map is clear with space for labeling or coloring by a young child.
2. **Use in Lesson 1 (15 minutes)**:
   - Present the map during Lesson 1’s main activity: “This is Antigua from colonial times. Let’s find the big buildings the Spanish made!”
   - Guide the student to color or label key sites as instructed in the lesson plan.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Used in Lesson 1 to color or label colonial buildings (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**: Check map accuracy during Lesson 1 narration (e.g., “Where’s the cathedral?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Portfolio inclusion of the map shows spatial and historical understanding.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label additional sites (e.g., Casa Santo Domingo).
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-label key buildings; focus on coloring.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 10-15 minutes (sourcing or drawing).
- Use in Lesson: 15 minutes (per Lesson 1).

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring/labeling skills.
- **Parent**: Ability to source or draw a simple map.

## Parental Involvement
- Prepare the map before Lesson 1.
- Assist with labeling or coloring during the lesson.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge map; use bold markers.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label or use stickers for names.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes internet or drawing access; hand-drawn works if no printer.
- Simplified map may omit minor sites for age-appropriateness.
