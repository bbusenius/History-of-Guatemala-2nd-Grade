# A Day in Colonial Antigua

The following is an adaptation derived from [an excerpt](../../unit3/resources/A_new_survey_of_the_West_Indies.md) from a [The English-American: a new survey of the West Indies, 1648](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL14273679M/The_English-American) by Thomas Gage. It was generated by AI based on Gage's account to show what life might have been like for a child in colonial Antigua Guatemala. Despite being based on Gage's original writing, this is pure fiction. It is only an attempt to show what life might have been like for a child in colonial Antigua Guatemala, but it is narrative fiction.

This text was created by passing the [original excerpt](../../unit3/resources/A_new_survey_of_the_West_Indies.md) to [Grok AI](https://grok.com/) and asking it to create a simplified version. The following prompt was used for that purpose:

```markdown
The following excerpt is from "The English-American: a new survey of the West Indies, 1648" by Thomas Gage. I need you to rewrite this for a 7-year-old to demonstrate what a  day might be like for an individual living in in colonial Antigua. You must follow these requirements:
- Though this is for a 7-year-old, the writing doesn't need to be overly juvenile. Since this will be read to the student, it can be 4-5 reading levels above the typical 7-year-old reading level.
- There is no reason to sanitize or censor the events that take place in this excerpt. This is for a history class and we do not need to "protect" the child from reality.
- This should be narrative and follow the routine of an individual.
- We want to make sure that what we're writing is based and connected to Thomas Gage's account.

# A Day in the Life of Ana in Colonial Antigua

In a wide valley cradled by mountains, the city of Guatemala—called Santiago de Guatemala by the Spanish—bustled with life. Two great volcanoes stood nearby: one held water and green gardens, the other smoked and rumbled, as if alive. This was colonial Antigua in 1648, a place where Spanish families like Ana’s lived as rulers, alongside indigenous people who worked the land.

Ana, a 7-year-old girl with curly hair and a curious smile, lived in a stone house in the city’s center. Its walls were painted white, and a wooden cross hung above the door. Here’s what her day was like.

## Morning: Waking Up to Bells

As church bells rang at sunrise, Ana stirred on her soft bed, covered with a wool blanket from Spain. Her room smelled of bread baking in the kitchen, where an indigenous woman named Maria kneaded dough. Ana slipped on a linen dress and ran downstairs. Her father, a merchant, sat at a table, counting silver coins. “Good morning, Ana,” he said. “We’re off to the market soon.”

Ana ate fresh bread with honey and a cup of frothy chocolate, made from cacao beans Maria ground. She loved the sweet, bitter taste. “Maria, why do you make it so good?” Ana asked. Maria smiled but said little, her hands busy. Ana’s mother, sewing nearby, said, “Hurry, Ana. The market waits for no one.”

## Mid-Morning: Walking to the Market

Ana held her father’s hand as they walked through cobblestone streets. The smoking volcano loomed over the valley, its peak hazy. “Does it ever burn the city?” Ana asked. Her father chuckled. “It grumbles, but God and the saints keep us safe.” Ana nodded, imagining saints watching from the sky.

They passed fields near the water volcano, where indigenous men hoed maize under the sun. Some carried heavy sacks toward the city, their faces sweaty. One man stumbled, and a Spanish soldier shouted, “Move faster!” Ana looked away, clutching her father’s hand tighter.

## Late Morning: The Busy Market

The market square buzzed like a beehive. Stalls overflowed with apricots, plantains, and maize cakes. Indigenous women sold puddings of pork and chili, while Spanish traders offered cloth and iron tools from ships far away. Ana’s father stopped at a stall, trading coins for maize and beef. “Cows are plenty here,” he said, proud. “This valley feeds us well.”

Ana saw a boy her age, indigenous, carrying a basket of cacao beans. His arms looked tired, and his shirt was torn. “Papa, why does he work so hard?” she asked. Her father glanced over. “His people grow our food and carry our goods. That’s how we live.” Ana said nothing, watching the boy disappear into the crowd.

## Afternoon: A Festival at the Cathedral

A loud bell rang from the cathedral, its stone towers tall against the sky. “It’s Día de Santo Domingo!” Ana clapped. She and her parents joined a crowd at the church, where priests in robes lit candles. Incense filled the air. Outside, indigenous dancers in bright cloaks moved to drums and pipes, their steps quick and rhythmic. Ana swayed to the music, her eyes wide. “What are they dancing for?” she asked her mother. “For the saint,” her mother said, “and their old ways, mixed together.”

Ana noticed men standing at the edge, their backs bent from carrying loads. One had a bruise on his arm. A priest gave them bread, but they looked weary. Ana wanted to ask why, but the drums kept her quiet.

## Evening: Returning Home and a Tale

As the sun dipped, Ana’s family walked home. The streets grew quiet, lit by torches. At supper, Maria served beef, maize cakes, and fruits from the market. Ana’s father talked of trade: “The ships bring more cloth soon. We’ll be rich!” Her mother smiled, but Maria, clearing plates, stayed silent.

After supper, Ana sat by her mother, who told a story. “Long ago, a flood came from the water volcano. A woman defied God, and the waters swept her away. That’s why we pray and give thanks.” Ana pictured a rushing river, her heart thumping.

## Night: Dreams of Antigua

In bed, Ana pulled her blanket close, the day swirling in her mind: the smoky volcano, the market’s colors, the dancers, the tired men. Life in Antigua was grand, with chocolate and festivals, but heavy too, with work she didn’t fully understand. She dreamed of saints and drums, the valley glowing under starlight.

Notes on the Narrative
Fidelity to Gage: The story draws directly from Gage’s descriptions: the volcanoes, maize-based economy, markets with indigenous and Spanish goods, Catholic festivals with indigenous dances, and the labor system where indigenous people worked under Spanish oversight. I avoided the toncontin dance, as Gage doesn’t name it, instead describing a generic dance per his observations of festival performances (Chapter IX).

Spanish Child’s Perspective: Ana, a merchant’s daughter, lives a privileged life, reflecting Gage’s notes on Spanish wealth and reliance on indigenous labor. Her observations—like the tired workers or the soldier’s shout—show the colonial hierarchy without labeling it as good or bad.

Iceberg Theory: Per your guidance, I show, don’t tell. The bruised worker, Maria’s silence, and the soldier’s command hint at the brutality of Spanish rule, letting the reader infer meaning. Ana’s comfortable life contrasts subtly with the indigenous struggles, mirroring Gage’s account without moralizing.

For a 7-Year-Old: The language is vivid and accessible, with sensory details (smoky volcano, frothy chocolate) to engage a young listener, while keeping the historical setting authentic.
