## Story Text: "A Day in Colonial Antigua"
Long ago, in the beautiful town of Antigua, there lived a young girl named Lucia. Antigua was a special place with big churches, colorful houses, and busy markets. The streets were made of cobblestones, and horses pulled carts filled with goods.

Lucia lived with her family in a house with thick walls and a red-tiled roof. Every morning, she helped her mother bake bread in a big oven. The smell of fresh bread filled the air, making everyone hungry.

After breakfast, Lucia went to the central plaza with her brother, Mateo. The plaza was the heart of Antigua, where people gathered to talk, play, and trade. In the middle stood a fountain, and around it were vendors selling fruits, vegetables, and handmade crafts.

“Look, Mateo!” Lucia said, pointing to a man with a basket of bright red strawberries. “Let’s buy some for Mama.”

They bought the strawberries and then visited the cathedral. The cathedral was the biggest church in Antigua, with tall bell towers and beautiful paintings inside. Lucia liked to look at the statues and imagine the stories they told.

After the cathedral, they went to the market. The market was loud and colorful, with people selling cloth, pottery, and even live chickens! Lucia’s favorite part was the candy stall, where she could get a sweet treat.

As the sun began to set, Lucia and Mateo returned home. Their father was a carpenter, and he was finishing a wooden chair. “How was your day?” he asked.

“We saw the cathedral and the market!” Lucia exclaimed. “And we bought strawberries for Mama.”

That evening, the family sat together for dinner, sharing stories of their day. Lucia loved living in Antigua, with its history, beauty, and bustling life.

And so, life in colonial Antigua went on, with its mix of Spanish and Maya traditions, creating a unique and vibrant culture.
