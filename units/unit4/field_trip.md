# Field Trip Plan: Unit 4 - Museo de Arte Colonial

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on colonial architecture and life by visiting the Museo de Arte Colonial in Antigua, Guatemala, connecting Unit 4’s Lessons 1 and 2 to historical art and architecture. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration, this optional 2-3 hour trip leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of colonial art and architecture.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemala’s colonial heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least one colonial art piece or architectural feature (e.g., painting, arch).
2. Connect the museum visit to Lessons 1-2 about colonial architecture and daily life.
3. Sketch one art piece or feature to demonstrate engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo by bus or car).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or plain paper), pencils, crayons (household items or ~$2-$5 if purchased).
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for safety and engagement tips (provided in curriculum).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos (to aid narration), magnifying glass for art details.
- **Accessibility**: Entry fee is 8Q for Guatemalan citizens, 50Q for foreigners (verify current rates); materials are low-cost; transportation costs vary (e.g., bus fare ~$1-$2 round trip).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (15-30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe and educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and explain the purpose: “We’re visiting a museum to see art and buildings from when the Spanish lived here.”
     - Gather materials (sketchbook, pencils, water, snacks) and pack in a small bag.
     - Check museum hours (Tuesday-Sunday, 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM, closed 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM on weekends) and plan transportation (~15-30 minutes by bus or car).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10-15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the museum.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at Museo de Arte Colonial and locate the main exhibit area or guided tour start.
     - Provide a brief overview: “This museum has paintings and sculptures from the colonial times, and the building was a university long ago.”
     - Set expectations: “We’ll look at the art and draw one thing you like.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the museum and complete the sketching activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Guide the student through exhibits, focusing on paintings (e.g., Passion of Christ by Tomás de Merlo) or architectural features (e.g., cloisters).
     - Encourage observation: “What do you see in this painting? What does the building’s arch look like?”
     - Supervise the sketching activity: Choose one art piece or feature to draw, noting details (e.g., “It’s a saint with a gold frame”). Allow 15-20 minutes for sketching.
     - Explore additional exhibits if time permits, noting interesting finds for discussion.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15-30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect briefly and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch and ask, “What did you learn about colonial art or buildings today?”
     - Discuss one observation (e.g., “This painting tells a story about Jesus”).
     - Depart the museum, ensuring all belongings are collected.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - Sketch one colonial art piece (e.g., painting, sculpture) or architectural feature (e.g., arch, cloister), noting its features (e.g., “It’s colorful with a gold frame”). Takes 15-20 minutes during exploration.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe engagement during sketching (e.g., focus, curiosity about exhibits).
  - Listen to initial reflections at wrap-up (e.g., “What did you see?”) to gauge understanding of colonial art or architecture.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Use the sketch and “Post-Trip Discussion” questions at home to assess recall and connection to Unit 4 lessons.
  - Collect the sketch for the portfolio, evaluating participation and comprehension informally (no rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Sketch multiple features or add a short note (e.g., “This painting is about a saint”).
  - Encourage detailed observations (e.g., “What do you think this art was used for?”).
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Simplify to sketching basic shapes (e.g., a frame or arch outline); use a camera to capture instead, discussing later.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Encourage pointing to features or mimicking poses in sculptures.
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Use photos taken during the trip or a magnifying glass to focus on art details.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 15-30 minutes (before departure)
- Arrival and Orientation: 10-15 minutes
- Exploration and Activity: 1-2 hours
- Wrap-Up and Departure: 15-30 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (flexible based on parent’s schedule)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic observation and drawing skills (developed in prior units); familiarity with colonial history from Unit 4, Lessons 1-2.
- **Parent**: Ability to plan logistics (e.g., transportation, timing); basic facilitation skills (e.g., guiding observation, prompting questions).

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Review this plan, gather materials, and arrange transportation to Antigua (e.g., bus or car).
- **Facilitation**: Accompany the student, guide them through exhibits, and assist with sketching (e.g., holding the sketchbook).
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing observations (e.g., “What story does this painting tell?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct the post-trip discussion at home and store the sketch in the student’s portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe art aloud; use a magnifying glass for small details.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with sketching (e.g., trace outlines) or use a camera instead.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten the visit to 1 hour or take a snack break midway.
