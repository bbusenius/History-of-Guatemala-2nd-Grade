# Field Trip Plan: Unit 4 - Colonial Antigua: Museo Colonial and Catedral de San José

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on colonial architecture and life by visiting two significant sites in Antigua, Guatemala: the Museo Colonial and the Catedral de San José. This trip connects Unit 3’s Lessons 1 and 2 (Spanish arrival and colonial life) and Unit 4’s Lessons 1 and 2 (colonial architecture and daily life) to historical art and architecture, using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration. Designed as an optional 3-5 hour trip (depending on sites visited), it leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of colonial art and architecture at two distinct sites.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemala’s colonial heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least one colonial art piece or architectural feature (e.g., painting, arch) at the Museo Colonial.
2. Recognize key features of colonial architecture (e.g., arches, bell towers) at the Catedral de San José.
3. Connect the museum and cathedral visits to Unit 3 and Unit 4 lessons about Spanish arrival, colonial architecture, and daily life.
4. Sketch one art piece or architectural feature from one or both sites to demonstrate engagement with the historical context.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo by bus or car).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or plain paper), pencils, crayons (household items or ~$2-$5 if purchased).
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for safety and engagement tips (provided in curriculum).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos (to aid narration), magnifying glass or binoculars for art and architectural details.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; entry fees for Museo Colonial (~$3-$5, verify current rates) and Catedral de San José (free or small donation ~$1-$2, verify); transportation costs vary (e.g., bus fare ~$1-$2).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30-45 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe, educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and say, “We’re visiting the Museo Colonial and Catedral de San José in Antigua to see how people lived during colonial times!”
     - Decide which site(s) to visit based on time: Museo Colonial only (~2-3 hours total), Catedral only (~1.5-2 hours), or both (~3-5 hours).
     - Pack essentials and activity materials.
     - Plan transportation; check current site hours (Museo Colonial: typically 9 AM - 5 PM, verify; Catedral: typically 9 AM - 5 PM, verify).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10-15 minutes per site)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the site(s).
   - **Procedure for Museo Colonial**:
     - Arrive at the museum; point out the entrance (preferably through Paseo de Los Museos on 1a Avenida Norte to save on entrance fees): "This museum has old art from colonial times."
     - Say, "Let's look at paintings or objects and draw something you like."
     - Make sure to visit and draw attention to the painting of [San Miguel Arcángel con las ánimas del Purgatorio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hjV2X82wC666FdNy6), connecting it back to lessons on colonial religious art.
     - Visit the crypts in the bottom of the churches.
   - **Procedure for Catedral de San José**:
     - Arrive at the cathedral; point out features: "Look at the big doors and tower!"
     - Say, "This is from colonial times. We'll draw something you like."
     - Make sure to visit both the main cathedral and the cathedral ruins on 5a Calle Oriente.
     - Visit the "Capilla de los Reyes" in the ruins and explain that this is likely where Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish conquistador who led the conquest of Guatemala, is buried.
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours per site)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site(s) and sketch.
   - **Procedure for Museo Colonial**:
     - Explore exhibits, focusing on paintings, sculptures, or artifacts; read or summarize key placards if possible.
     - Ask, “What do you think this art shows about colonial life?” (e.g., “People praying” or “Old clothes”).
     - Sketch one piece (e.g., a painting) in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines/colors.
   - **Procedure for Catedral de San José**:
     - Explore the facade, towers, and interior (if open), noting details (e.g., arches).
     - Ask, “What do you think this was used for?” (e.g., “Church for praying”).
     - Sketch one feature (e.g., a window) in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines/colors.
   - Allow free exploration if time remains at either site.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes per site)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch(es): “What did you draw? Why?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn about colonial times?”
     - Ensure all belongings are collected and depart.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one feature or art piece from each visited site (e.g., painting at Museo Colonial; window or tower at Catedral) in 15-20 minutes per sketch, noting its use (e.g., “For decoration” or “For bells”).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement during exploration; listen to responses to questions (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect sketch(es) for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to informally assess recall and connection to Unit 3 and Unit 4 lessons.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple features or add written notes (e.g., “This painting shows a saint”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw basic shapes (e.g., a square window or circle for art); use a camera if sketching is challenging.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to or touch features (if permitted) while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or magnifying glass/binoculars to focus on details.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 30-45 minutes
- Arrival/Orientation: 10-15 minutes per site
- Exploration/Activity: 1-2 hours per site
- Wrap-Up/Departure: 15 minutes per site
- Total: 3-5 hours (flexible, depending on sites visited)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic drawing skills; familiarity with Unit 3 (Spanish arrival, colonial life) and Unit 4 (colonial architecture, daily life) lessons.
- **Parent**: Logistics planning; basic facilitation skills for guiding observation.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Plan transport to Antigua and pack materials.
- **Facilitation**: Guide exploration at each site, assist with sketching, prompt questions (e.g., “What do you see?”).
- **Engagement**: Discuss observations during exploration (e.g., “What’s different from our house?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct post-trip discussion; store sketch(es) in portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe art or architecture aloud; use magnifying tools if available.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with sketching or take photos instead.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten visit per site to 1 hour with breaks.
