# Unit 4, Lesson 1: Colonial Architecture in Antigua

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to colonial architecture in Antigua, Guatemala, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Focusing on key buildings like the Catedral de San José and La Merced Church, it uses mapping, picture study, and discussion to explore Spanish influence. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—observation, narration, and short lessons—it engages the student in San Juan del Obispo, near Antigua, connecting history to their local environment and enriching cultural context through art appreciation.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: While no specific book is used, the lesson leverages real-world examples and visual art as living resources to inspire learning.
- **Narration**: Includes oral retelling after mapping and picture study to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments activities into concise blocks (e.g., 5-minute picture study) to maintain focus.
- **Picture Study**: Incorporates a 5-minute segment with a colonial painting to cultivate observation skills and cultural appreciation, per Charlotte Mason’s guidelines.
- **Hands-On**: Mapping provides kinesthetic engagement with historical geography.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least two key colonial buildings in Antigua (e.g., Catedral de San José, La Merced Church).
2. Label or color these buildings on a map of Antigua.
3. Observe and describe features of a colonial painting (e.g., colors, shapes) during picture study.
4. Narrate one architectural feature (e.g., arches, bell towers) or painting observation.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce colonial architecture and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 3: "The Spanish came and built towns. Today, we'll explore their buildings in Antigua!"
     - Say, "They made big churches and houses with special designs. Let's find them on a map and look at a painting!"
     - Show the map and briefly point to key areas (e.g., "Here's where the cathedral is").

2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore Spanish Colonial architecture through discussion, mapping, and picture study.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Exploring Spanish Colonial Architecture (15 minutes)**:
       - Open the [Spanish Colonial Architecture Guide](resources/spanish_colonial_architecture.md) on a device or print it out.
       - Go through the main characteristics together, focusing on features they might see in Antigua:
         - Thick white stucco walls
         - Red clay roof tiles
         - Arches over doors and windows
         - Central courtyards
         - Bell towers
       - Show examples from the document and ask questions like:
         - "Have you seen any of these features in Antigua?"
         - "Why do you think they used these designs?" (e.g., thick walls keep buildings cool)

       - Point out that many buildings in Antigua have these special Spanish Colonial features.

     - **Mapping (15 minutes)**: 
       - Provide [the map](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antigua_Guatemala_location_map.JPG#mw-jump-to-license) and crayons. Guide the student to color or label the Catedral de San José, La Merced Church, and central plaza.
       - Ask, "What Spanish Colonial features do you think these buildings have? Let's look for them on the map!"
     
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: 
       - Show the colonial painting image: [San Miguel Arcángel con las ánimas del Purgatorio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hjV2X82wC666FdNy6), Siglo XVIII (artist unknown)
       - Say, "Now let's look at this colonial painting from the 18th century."
       - After 2 minutes of observation, discuss: "What did you see?"

4. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, "Tell me about the Spanish Colonial buildings we learned about today. What features make them special?"
     - Encourage them to mention specific features from the guide and where they saw them (on the map, in the painting, or in real life if they've visited Antigua).

5. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, "Today we learned that Spanish Colonial buildings have special features like thick white walls, red tile roofs, and beautiful arches. These buildings help tell the story of Antigua's history."
     - Preview, "Next, we'll learn about life inside this town!"
     - Add a building sketch (e.g., cathedral) to the timeline's Colonial section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Mapping**: Color or label key buildings on the map to explore spatial history (15 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss a colonial painting to appreciate art and architecture (5 minutes).
  - **Discussion**: Talk about architectural features to deepen understanding (5 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Mapping**: Check map accuracy (e.g., cathedral labeled correctly); ask, “Where’s La Merced Church?” to assess recognition.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “I saw red roofs”) for detail and memory.
  - **Narration**: Listen for inclusion of architectural or painting details (e.g., towers, colors) to gauge comprehension.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the map for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and accuracy.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 4 connection, focusing on creativity and relevance (no formal rubric; based on engagement).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label additional buildings (e.g., Casa Santo Domingo) or describe multiple painting features in narration.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-label the map with stickers; focus on one building or painting detail for narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional images or the painting to reinforce details during discussion.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to map locations or hold the painting image while narrating.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 35 minutes (15 min architecture exploration, 15 min mapping, 5 min picture study and discussion)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 55 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring and labeling skills; familiarity with Spanish arrival from Unit 3.
- **Parent**: Ability to source or draw a map and find an online image; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Source or draw the map as per `units/unit4/resources/colonial_antigua_map.md` and find a colonial painting image online (~10-15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Guide mapping, present the picture study, lead discussion, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What do you like about these old buildings?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the map in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student’s sketch.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map and painting image; describe features aloud (e.g., “The painting has white walls”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label the map with stickers or assist with coloring; allow verbal narration without writing.
- **Attention Span**: Split mapping and picture study into two 12-minute segments with a short break.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “plaza/plaza”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes internet access for sourcing the painting image; an offline alternative is a parent-drawn sketch of a colonial building if unavailable.
- Assumes map access via drawing or printing; a hand-drawn option is provided if no printer.
- Relies on Unit 3 context; recap Spanish arrival briefly (“The Spanish came long ago”) if needed.
