# Unit 4, Lesson 1: Colonial Architecture in Antigua

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to colonial architecture in Antigua, Guatemala, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Focusing on key buildings like the Catedral de San José and La Merced Church, it uses mapping, picture study, and discussion to explore Spanish influence. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—observation, narration, and short lessons—it engages the student in San Juan del Obispo, near Antigua, connecting history to their local environment and enriching cultural context through art appreciation.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: While no specific book is used, the lesson leverages real-world examples and visual art as living resources to inspire learning.
- **Narration**: Includes oral retelling after mapping and picture study to enhance comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments activities into concise blocks (e.g., 5-minute picture study) to maintain focus.
- **Picture Study**: Incorporates a 5-minute segment with a colonial painting to cultivate observation skills and cultural appreciation, per Charlotte Mason’s guidelines.
- **Hands-On**: Mapping provides kinesthetic engagement with historical geography.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least two key colonial buildings in Antigua (e.g., Catedral de San José, La Merced Church).
2. Label or color these buildings on a map of Antigua.
3. Observe and describe features of a colonial painting (e.g., colors, shapes) during picture study.
4. Narrate one architectural feature (e.g., arches, bell towers) or painting observation.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Map**: Printable or hand-drawn map of colonial Antigua (from `units/unit4/resources/colonial_antigua_map.md`; instructions for sourcing or drawing provided).
- **Picture Study Image**: A high-quality image of a colonial painting, such as "View of Antigua" by an 18th-century artist from the Museo de Arte Colonial collection. Source online via museum websites (e.g., search “Museo de Arte Colonial Antigua Guatemala paintings” on Google Arts & Culture, https://artsandculture.google.com) or use a free, high-resolution image labeled for reuse (e.g., via Wikimedia Commons).
- **Crayons or Markers**: For coloring or labeling the map (household items or ~$2-$5).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For noting narration observations if desired (household items).
- **Optional**: Additional images of colonial buildings for reference (e.g., search “Antigua Guatemala colonial architecture” online; free printable resources).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; map can be hand-drawn if no printer; internet access needed for image sourcing, with offline alternatives provided.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce colonial architecture and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 3: “The Spanish came and built towns. Today, we’ll explore their buildings in Antigua!”
     - Say, “They made big churches and houses with special designs. Let’s find them on a map and look at a painting!”
     - Show the map and briefly point to key areas (e.g., “Here’s where the cathedral is”).
2. **Main Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore architecture through mapping, picture study, and discussion.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Mapping (15 minutes)**: Provide the map and crayons. Guide the student to color or label the Catedral de San José, La Merced Church, and central plaza (e.g., “Make the cathedral yellow!”). Ask, “What do you think these buildings were used for?”
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the colonial painting image. Say, “Look at this picture for 2 minutes. Notice the colors and shapes.” After 2 minutes, cover the image and ask, “What did you see? What shapes or colors do you remember?” Then, uncover it and discuss: “What buildings do you see? How do they look different from today?”
     - **Discussion (5 minutes)**: Connect the painting to the map. Ask, “How are these buildings like the ones on your map?” or “What makes them look old?” Suggest features like arches or towers.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the buildings on your map or what you saw in the picture.”
     - Listen for details (e.g., “The church has a tower” or “The painting had red roofs”) and note a key idea for the portfolio (e.g., “The cathedral is big”).
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “These buildings and paintings show how the Spanish lived in Antigua long ago.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn about life inside this town!”
     - Add a building sketch (e.g., cathedral) to the timeline’s Colonial section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Mapping**: Color or label key buildings on the map to explore spatial history (15 minutes).
  - **Picture Study**: Observe and discuss a colonial painting to appreciate art and architecture (5 minutes).
  - **Discussion**: Talk about architectural features to deepen understanding (5 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Mapping**: Check map accuracy (e.g., cathedral labeled correctly); ask, “Where’s La Merced Church?” to assess recognition.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “I saw red roofs”) for detail and memory.
  - **Narration**: Listen for inclusion of architectural or painting details (e.g., towers, colors) to gauge comprehension.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the map for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and accuracy.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 4 connection, focusing on creativity and relevance (no formal rubric; based on engagement).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Label additional buildings (e.g., Casa Santo Domingo) or describe multiple painting features in narration.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-label the map with stickers; focus on one building or painting detail for narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Use optional images or the painting to reinforce details during discussion.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to map locations or hold the painting image while narrating.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 25 minutes (15 min mapping, 5 min picture study, 5 min discussion)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring and labeling skills; familiarity with Spanish arrival from Unit 3.
- **Parent**: Ability to source or draw a map and find an online image; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Source or draw the map as per `units/unit4/resources/colonial_antigua_map.md` and find a colonial painting image online (~10-15 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Guide mapping, present the picture study, lead discussion, and prompt narration with provided questions.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by asking, “What do you like about these old buildings?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the map in the portfolio and update the timeline with the student’s sketch.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the map and painting image; describe features aloud (e.g., “The painting has white walls”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-label the map with stickers or assist with coloring; allow verbal narration without writing.
- **Attention Span**: Split mapping and picture study into two 12-minute segments with a short break.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “plaza/plaza”) to reinforce vocabulary; allow narration in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes internet access for sourcing the painting image; an offline alternative is a parent-drawn sketch of a colonial building if unavailable.
- Assumes map access via drawing or printing; a hand-drawn option is provided if no printer.
- Relies on Unit 3 context; recap Spanish arrival briefly (“The Spanish came long ago”) if needed.
