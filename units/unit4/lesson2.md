# Lesson Plan: Unit 4, Lesson 2 - Daily Life in Colonial Times

## Overview
This lesson explores daily life in colonial Antigua, Guatemala, for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through storytelling with "A Day in Colonial Antigua," a dictation exercise, and crafting a colonial hat, the student will learn about routines, markets, and society during the colonial period. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living stories, and hands-on activities—it connects to the student’s context near Antigua from San Juan del Obispo, building on Lesson 1’s architecture focus and enhancing spelling through dictation.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses "A Day in Colonial Antigua" as a narrative-driven story to bring history to life, adhering to Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on engaging texts.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling of the story, enhancing comprehension and oral skills.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling to 10 minutes and dictation to 5 minutes to maintain focus.
- **Hands-On**: Incorporates a craft to connect kinesthetic learning with historical context.
- **Dictation**: Includes a dictation exercise to practice spelling and reinforce historical content, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s method of engaging with material through writing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe one aspect of colonial daily life in Antigua (e.g., markets, family roles).
2. Create a paper colonial hat to represent the era’s fashion.
3. Write a dictated sentence about colonial life with correct spelling.
4. Narrate a scene from the story or hat’s imagined use, linking to colonial society.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "A Day in Colonial Antigua" (from `units/unit4/resources/colonial_life_story.md`; print or read from a device).
- **Dictation Sentence**: "The plaza was busy." (English) or "La plaza estaba ocupada." (Spanish), derived from "A Day in Colonial Antigua."
- **Craft Supplies**: Construction paper (brown or black for authenticity), scissors, glue or tape, markers (household or ~$5-$10 total).
- **Craft Instructions**: From `units/unit4/resources/colonial_craft.md` (provided in curriculum).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation exercise (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of colonial Antigua markets or churches (e.g., search “colonial Antigua Guatemala market” online; free).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; substitutes (e.g., plain paper) work if needed.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce colonial daily life and activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: “We saw colonial buildings. Today, we’ll learn how people lived in them!”
     - Say, “We’ll hear a story, write a sentence, and make a hat like they wore!”
     - Show optional images if available to set the scene.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore colonial life through story, dictation, and craft.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "A Day in Colonial Antigua" aloud with enthusiasm. Ask, “What did Lucia do at the plaza?” to connect to daily life.
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence from Lucia’s story.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "The plaza was busy." (English) or "La plaza estaba ocupada." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “You got ‘plaza’ right!”).
     - **Craft (15 minutes)**: Follow the craft guide: Cut a paper strip and circle, assemble into a tricorn hat, decorate with markers. Discuss, “Who might wear this hat in Lucia’s town?”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “What was life like in the story?” or “Who might wear your hat and why?”
     - Encourage links to the story (e.g., “They went to the plaza”). Note a key idea (e.g., “The plaza was busy”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview the field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Guatemala became independent, but colonial art and buildings are still here.”
     - Preview, “Soon, we’ll visit [Museo Colonial and Catedral de San José](field_trip.md) to see colonial art and architecture up close!”
     - **Update Timeline**: Add a flag to the Independence section with the student.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "A Day in Colonial Antigua" to explore daily routines (10 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to the story (5 minutes).
  - **Crafting**: Make a colonial hat to visualize fashion (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., plaza, market) to assess comprehension.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “busy” or “ocupada”).
  - **Craft**: Observe effort; ask, “Who wears your hat?” to check historical connection.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and hat for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical connection informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 4 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add a second dictation sentence or detailed hat decorations; narrate additional facts (e.g., “They traded at the plaza”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut hat pieces; simplify narration to “What did Lucia see?”; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Wear the hat and act out a market scene during narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to spark ideas for hat decoration or story retelling.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min story, 5 min dictation, 15 min craft)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include dictation without reducing other sections)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting/gluing and writing skills (with help); Lesson 1’s architecture intro.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, assist with craft, and conduct dictation; no historical expertise needed.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the story; gather craft supplies (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read story, dictate the sentence clearly, assist with cutting and decorating, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Discuss, “What would you do in colonial Antigua?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and hat in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge text or use bold markers; describe images aloud if used.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut shapes; assist with writing or assembly; use larger paper.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten story to 7 minutes or craft to 10 minutes with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use “plaza/plaza” and “ocupada/busy” bilingually; allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes craft supply access; substitutes (e.g., plain paper) work if needed.
- Requires adult help for scissors; pre-cut if unavailable.
- Assumes Lesson 1 context; recap architecture briefly if missed.
