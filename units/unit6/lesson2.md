# Lesson Plan: Unit 6, Lesson 2 - Peace and Unity

## Overview
This lesson explores the end of Guatemala’s civil war and the 1996 peace accords for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history. Through storytelling with "The Day of Peace" and crafting a peace dove, the student will learn about peace as a positive outcome of the 20th century. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, storytelling, and hands-on activities—it’s engaging and tailored to the student in San Juan del Obispo, connecting history to themes of unity and hope.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards per the course rules. The lesson supports educational goals by:
- Fostering historical understanding through a chronological exploration of modern Guatemala.
- Encouraging narrative skills via oral retelling, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s focus on language development.
- Integrating art with history through crafting, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to Guatemala’s peace process.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand that Guatemala’s civil war ended with the 1996 peace accords.
2. Retell key elements of "The Day of Peace" in their own words.
3. Create a peace dove to symbolize unity after conflict.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "The Day of Peace" (saved as `units/unit6/resources/the_day_of_peace.md`; print or read from a device).
- **Craft Supplies**: White paper, scissors, markers (household or ~$2-$5); optional googly eyes, feathers (~$1-$2).
- **Craft Instructions**: From `units/unit6/resources/peace_dove.md`.
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of peace celebrations or doves (e.g., search “Guatemala peace accords 1996” online; free printable resources).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost, common materials; printer or device for story; substitutes (e.g., pencils) viable.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce peace and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: “Guatemala got modern. Today, we’ll learn how it found peace after a big fight.”
     - Say, “In 1996, people agreed to stop fighting and work together. Let’s see how!”
2. **Main Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore peace through story and craft.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (15 minutes)**: Read "The Day of Peace" aloud with expression. Pause to ask, “What does peace mean to you?” Show optional images if available.
     - **Craft (10 minutes)**: Provide materials and follow the craft guide: Draw and cut a dove shape, decorate with markers, add optional eyes/feathers. Say, “This dove means peace, like in the story!”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about Carlos’s day” or “What does peace mean in Guatemala?”
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., “They stopped fighting”). Note a key idea (e.g., “Peace came in 1996”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The peace accords in 1996 made Guatemala happier.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll visit a [local market](field_trip.md) to see today’s Guatemala!”
     - Add a dove drawing to the timeline’s Modern section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "The Day of Peace" to understand the peace accords (15 minutes).
  - **Crafting**: Make a peace dove to symbolize unity (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., celebration, doves) to assess comprehension.
  - **Craft**: Observe effort and connection (e.g., dove as peace) to gauge engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dove for the portfolio, evaluating participation and understanding informally.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 6 connection.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate extra details (e.g., “They signed a paper”) or add dove details.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to “What did Carlos see?”; pre-cut dove shape.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Fly the dove like a puppet while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to reinforce story and craft concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 25 minutes (15 min story, 10 min craft)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting/drawing skills (with help); modernization from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud and assist with craft; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the story; gather craft supplies (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read the story, help with cutting/decorating, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Discuss, “What would peace feel like?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dove in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge text or use bold markers; describe images aloud.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut dove; assist with decorating; use large paper.
- **Attention Span**: Split story and craft into two 12-minute segments with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use “paz/peace” and “acuerdos/accords” bilingually.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes craft supply access; pencils substitute if markers unavailable.
- Requires adult help for scissors; pre-cut if needed.
- Relies on Lesson 1; recap modernization if missed.
