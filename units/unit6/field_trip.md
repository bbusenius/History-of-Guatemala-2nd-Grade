# Field Trip Plan: Unit 6 - Visit to Casa de la Memoria

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. Following Unit 6's lessons on 20th century Guatemala and the civil war, this visit to Casa de la Memoria in Guatemala City offers an immersive educational experience about Guatemala's history, with special focus on the civil war period. The museum presents history through carefully curated exhibits that examine different periods and aspects of Guatemala's past. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired approaches of firsthand observation and narration, this 2-3 hour visit can be conducted either in-person or virtually through the museum's website (https://casadelamemoria.org.gt/).

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason's philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Deepening historical understanding through exposure to primary sources, photographs, and testimonies.
- Encouraging narrative skills through guided reflection and post-visit discussion.
- Developing critical thinking by examining different perspectives on historical events.
- Creating meaningful connections between classroom learning about the civil war and visual/multimedia representations.
- Supporting character development through reflection on themes of justice, memory, and reconciliation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least three key events or periods from Guatemala's history presented in the museum.
2. Connect exhibits about the civil war to concepts learned in the classroom lessons.
3. Express personal responses to at least one exhibit through simple narration or drawing.
4. Recognize the importance of remembering difficult historical events.
5. Describe how museums help preserve historical memory.
