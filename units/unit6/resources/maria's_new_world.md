# Maria’s New World

Maria lived in a small town in Guatemala with her family. It was the year 1935, and life was simple. They used candles and oil lamps for light at night, and horses or donkeys to travel.

One morning, Maria’s father came home excited. “Maria, something wonderful is coming to our town!” he said.

“What is it, Papa?” Maria asked.

“You’ll see soon,” he replied with a smile.

The next day, a big truck arrived, and men started digging holes and putting up tall poles with wires. Maria watched curiously. “Papa, what are they doing?”

“They’re bringing electricity to our town,” he explained. “Soon, we’ll have lights that turn on with a switch!”

Maria didn’t understand, but she was excited.

Over the next week, the workers connected the wires to the houses. Finally, the big day came. The whole town gathered in the plaza at sunset. The mayor stood up and said, “Tonight, we welcome a new era for our town!”

He flipped a switch, and suddenly, bright lights lit up the plaza. Everyone gasped and cheered. Maria looked up at the glowing bulbs, feeling like it was magic.

That night, in her home, Maria turned on the light in her room. It was so bright! She could read her book easily without a candle. “Thank you, electricity,” she whispered.

From that day, Maria’s town changed. People could work later, and life became a little easier. Maria always remembered the day the lights came to her town.
