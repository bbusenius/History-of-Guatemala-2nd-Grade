# The Day of Peace

Carlos lived in Antigua, Guatemala, with his family. It was 1996, and for as long as he could remember, there had been fighting in the country. But one day, his parents told him, “The war is ending! There’s going to be peace!”

Carlos didn’t fully understand, but he saw his parents were happy. “What’s peace, Mama?” he asked.

“Peace means no more fighting. People will work together instead,” she explained.

On December 29, 1996, Carlos’s family went to the central plaza. It was decorated with flags and banners. A big crowd had gathered, and there was music playing.

A man stood on a stage and said, “Today, we sign the peace accords. Guatemala will have peace!”

Everyone cheered loudly. Then, someone released white doves into the sky. “The doves mean peace,” Carlos’s father said.

Carlos watched the doves fly, feeling hopeful. There was dancing and singing, and people hugged each other. Carlos joined in, waving a small flag.

That night, his family had a special dinner to celebrate. “Now, Guatemala can grow and be happy,” his mother said.

Carlos went to bed thinking about the doves and the happy faces. He was glad the fighting was over.
