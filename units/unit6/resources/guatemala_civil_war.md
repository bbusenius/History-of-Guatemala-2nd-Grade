# Guatemala's Civil War (1960-1996)

Guatemala's civil war was a long conflict that lasted for 36 years. During this time, many people were hurt and families were separated. Let's learn about what happened, why it happened, and how it ended.

## What Was the Guatemalan Civil War?

The Guatemalan civil war was a fight between the government of Guatemala and groups of people who wanted to change how the country was run. Many of these groups were made up of Maya people, who are the original people of Guatemala [1].

This war happened during something called the "Cold War." The Cold War was not a regular war with fighting, but a time when two powerful countries—the United States and the Soviet Union—were competing for influence around the world. Some countries followed the United States' way of organizing their society (called capitalism), while others followed the Soviet Union's way (called communism) [2].

## How Long Did the Guatemalan Civil War Last?

The war officially took place between 1960 and 1996, which means it lasted for 36 years [3]. However, the problems that led to the war started earlier, in 1954, when the president of Guatemala, **Jacobo Arbenz**, was forced to leave his position. 

Before Arbenz became president, a large American company called the **United Fruit Company** owned a lot of land in Guatemala. They grew bananas and other fruits to sell in the United States. The company was so powerful that people sometimes called Guatemala a 'banana republic' because the fruit company had so much control over the country [4]. The United Fruit Company was the single largest landowner in Guatemala, with vast holdings throughout Central America, and they left about 85% of their land uncultivated [5]. This meant many Guatemalan farmers didn't have enough land to grow food for their families while the company kept most of its land unused.

When President Arbenz tried to help Guatemalan farmers by taking some of the unused land from the United Fruit Company (and paying them for it), the company became very angry. They asked the United States government for help [1]. The **Central Intelligence Agency** (CIA), which is like a special spy organization in the United States, created a secret plan called 'Operation PBSUCCESS' to remove President Arbenz from power [6]. 

The CIA trained a small army, used airplanes to drop leaflets telling people to fight against their government, and spread false information on the radio. In June 1954, these actions forced President Arbenz to resign, and a new leader who was friendly to the United Fruit Company was put in charge [7].

## What Caused the Guatemalan Civil War?

There were several important reasons why the civil war happened:

1. **Unfairness in society**: For hundreds of years, many Maya people did not have the same opportunities as others in Guatemala. They often didn't have enough land to grow food, and many lived in poverty [5].

2. **Political problems**: People who disagreed with the government were often not allowed to speak freely. When they tried to change things peacefully, they were sometimes threatened or harmed [1].

3. **International involvement**: Other countries, especially the United States, got involved in Guatemala's affairs. The United States was worried about communism spreading and supported Guatemala's military governments [6].

## What Happened During the War?

During the 36 years of war, many terrible things happened:

1. **Violence against communities**: The Guatemalan army attacked many villages where Maya people lived. They believed these communities were helping the groups fighting against the government. In some cases, entire villages were destroyed [7].

2. **People had to leave their homes**: Many families had to run away from their homes to stay safe. Some went to other parts of Guatemala, while others left the country completely [8].

3. **Many people were killed or disappeared**: More than 200,000 people were killed or went missing during the war. About 83% of those who were identified as victims were Maya people. Research shows that government forces were responsible for about 93% of these human rights violations [9].

   When we say people "disappeared," it means they were secretly taken away by government forces. Their families were not told where they were taken or what happened to them. This was called "forced disappearance." The government denied knowing anything about these people. Many families never found out what happened to their loved ones, which caused them great sadness. Some important writers, teachers, and community leaders were "disappeared" because they spoke out against the government [11]. One of these people was a Kaqchikel writer and teacher named **Luis de Lión**, who disappeared in 1984. His family didn't learn what happened to him for many years.

## How Did the War End?

After many years of fighting, people on both sides realized that the war needed to end. With help from the United Nations, Spain, and Norway, the different sides started talking to each other to find a peaceful solution [10].

In 1996, **President Álvaro Arzú** signed a peace agreement with the groups that had been fighting against the government. This officially ended the 36-year-long civil war [10].
