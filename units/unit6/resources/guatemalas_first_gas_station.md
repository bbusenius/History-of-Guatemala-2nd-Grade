# Guatemala's First Gas Station

A long time ago, around 100 years ago in 1923, people in Guatemala were just starting to use cars. But cars need something special to make them run - gasoline!

Before there were gas stations, people who owned cars had to buy gasoline in metal cans that came from far away countries. This made having a car very hard.

## The First Gas Station

A man named Walter Frank Siebold, who came to Guatemala from Wisconsin in the United States, saw that people with cars needed help. He opened the very first gas station in Guatemala! It was called "El Cielito," which means "Little Heaven."

At first, the gas station was just a small wooden booth with one light bulb in front. People could drive their cars there and fill them up with gasoline.

## What Made This Gas Station Special?

"El Cielito" was the first gas station in all of Central America that stayed open at night! This meant people could get gasoline even when it was dark outside.

The gas station sold gasoline from a Mexican oil company called "El √Åguila" (The Eagle).

Later, around 1927, the gas station got even better. They added a special machine that helped clean car parts with oil. This was a new and exciting service that made car owners very happy.

## Growing Bigger

As more years passed, more people got cars in Guatemala. By the 1930s, new gas stations opened in other parts of the country. This made it easier for people to travel farther in their cars.

By 1950, "El Cielito" had grown into a bigger business. They opened a garage where they could fix cars. They also sold car parts that came from other countries.
