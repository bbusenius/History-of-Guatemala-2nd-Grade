# Lesson Plan: Unit 6, Lesson 1 - Modernization in Guatemala

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to the modernization of Guatemala, focusing on the arrival of the first gas station in the early 20th century. Through a child-friendly reading about Guatemala's first gas station, a video about Guatemala's gas station history, a dictation exercise, a creative drawing activity, and a composer study of Paco Pérez's "Chichicastenango," the student learns about technological change and Guatemala's cultural heritage. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, primary sources, hands-on activities, and composer study—it's tailored for San Juan del Obispo near Antigua, connecting history to relatable concepts like transportation and building on Unit 5's independence focus.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the student and introduce modernization.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 5: "Guatemala got free. Today, we'll see how it got modern!"
     - Say, "Cars needed special places to get fuel. Let's learn about Guatemala's first gas station!"
     - Show optional images of old cars or gas stations if available.
2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore modernization through reading, video, composer study, dictation, and craft.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Reading (10 minutes)**: Read ["Guatemala's First Gas Station"](../resources/guatemalas_first_gas_station.md) aloud with enthusiasm. Ask, "How do you think cars changed the way people traveled?" to connect to the reading.
     - **Video Resource (5 minutes)**: Watch the YouTube video ["La gasolina en Guatemala"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZkB4CbEkEs). Ask, "What did you see in the video about old gas stations?" (Expect answers like "They looked different" or "They were small").
     - **Optional Video (3-5 minutes)**: If time permits and the student shows interest, watch portions of ["Rare Footage of Classic American Cars in Guatemala"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V_q_bGsCE) to see the types of cars that would have visited early gas stations.
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, "Let's write a sentence about what we learned."
         - Dictate the sentence: "'El Cielito' was the first gas station in all of Central America that stayed open at night!" (English) or "¡'El Cielito' fue la primera gasolinera en toda Centroamérica que permaneció abierta durante la noche!" (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., "You spelled 'Central America' great!").
     - **Composer Study (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Connect with Guatemala's musical heritage during the modernization period.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, "Let's listen to 'Chichicastenango' by Paco Pérez, a famous Guatemalan composer who lived from 1917 to 1951. This was the time when Guatemala was getting modern with gas stations and automobiles!"
         - Share these simple facts about Paco Pérez:
           - "Paco Pérez was born on April 25, 1917, in Huehuetenango, Guatemala."
           - "He started performing when he was only 6 years old in a children's theater!"
           - "His most famous song is called 'Luna de Xelajú' about the city of Quetzaltenango."
           - "He was also on the radio and played a funny character named Ciriaco Cintura."
           - "Sadly, he died in an airplane accident when he was only 34 years old."
           - "The song we're going to hear, 'Chichicastenango,' is named after a famous town in Guatemala."
         - Play a 2–3 minute instrumental marimba version of "Chichicastenango" (sourced from YouTube, e.g., search "Chichicastenango Paco Pérez marimba," such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb5528scfXU).
         - After listening, ask, "How does this music make you feel?" and "Do you think this music sounds modern or traditional?"
         - Explain, "The marimba is Guatemala's national instrument. Even as Guatemala was getting modern things like gas stations and cars, people kept playing traditional music. This shows how a country can keep its special culture while also getting new technology."

     - **Drawing Activity (10 minutes)**: Provide drawing paper and coloring supplies. Say, "Let's draw something about what we learned today! You could draw El Cielito gas station, a vintage car, people getting gas, or anything else that interested you from our lesson." Encourage creative expression and personal connection to the history they've learned.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, "Tell me about Guatemala's first gas station" or "What did you learn from the video?"
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., "Cars needed gas to run"). Note a key idea (e.g., "Gas stations helped people travel more") for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, "Guatemala got modern with cars and gas stations, making travel easier."
     - Preview, "Next, we'll learn about peace after a big fight!"
     - Add the first gas station to the timeline's Modern section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Reading**: Listen to "Guatemala's First Gas Station" to understand modernization (10 minutes).
  - **Video Engagement**: Watch and discuss the YouTube video about gas stations in Guatemala (5 minutes).
  - **Composer Study**: Listen to "Chichicastenango" by Paco Pérez (1916-1951) to connect with Guatemala's musical heritage during the modernization period (5 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to transportation (5 minutes).
  - **Drawing Activity**: Create a drawing related to the lesson to connect with transportation history (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:

  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 6 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate extra changes (e.g., "People could travel farther") or add detailed elements to their car drawing (e.g., historical background, gas station); write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to "What did gas stations do?"; provide simple car outlines for tracing; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Pretend to pump gas and drive a car while narrating; act out driving before drawing.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to reinforce reading and drawing concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 40 minutes (10 min reading, 5 min video, 5 min dictation, 10 min composer study, 10 min drawing activity)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 60 minutes (adjustable to 40-70 minute range)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, cutting, and writing skills (with help); independence from Unit 5.
