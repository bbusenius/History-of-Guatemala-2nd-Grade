# Lesson Plan: Unit 6, Lesson 1 - Modernization in Guatemala

## Overview
This lesson introduces a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student to the modernization of Guatemala, focusing on electricity’s arrival in the 20th century. Through storytelling with "Maria’s New World," a primary source newspaper clipping, a dictation exercise, and a paper lantern craft, the student learns about technological change. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, primary sources, and hands-on activities—it’s tailored for San Juan del Obispo near Antigua, connecting history to relatable concepts like light and building on Unit 5’s independence focus.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books and Primary Sources**: Features "Maria’s New World" and an unsimplified newspaper clipping from *Prensa Libre*, adhering to Charlotte Mason’s focus on authentic voices to make history relatable.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling for comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits storytelling and primary source segments to 15 minutes total to maintain focus.
- **Hands-On**: Uses a craft to reinforce historical concepts kinesthetically.
- **Dictation**: Includes a dictation exercise to practice spelling and connect to modernization, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s method of engaging with content through writing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Understand that Guatemala modernized with electricity in the 20th century.
2. Retell key elements of "Maria’s New World" in their own words.
3. Explain how electricity changed life based on the newspaper clipping.
4. Write a dictated sentence about electricity with correct spelling.
5. Create a paper lantern to symbolize this advancement.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Story**: "Maria’s New World" (from `units/unit6/resources/marias_new_world.md`; print or read from a device).
- **Primary Source**: Newspaper clipping from *Prensa Libre* (historical example): "Electricity Arrives in Guatemala City! The streets are now lit with electric lights, and soon, every home will have this modern convenience." (Spanish original: "¡La electricidad llega a la Ciudad de Guatemala! Las calles ahora están iluminadas con luces eléctricas, y pronto, cada hogar tendrá esta comodidad moderna." Available via online archives or historical texts; English translation provided.)
- **Dictation Sentence**: "The lights came on." (English) or "Las luces se encendieron." (Spanish), derived from "Maria’s New World."
- **Craft Supplies**: Construction paper (any color), tissue paper (yellow/white), scissors, glue, markers (household or ~$5-$10 total).
- **Craft Instructions**: From `units/unit6/resources/paper_lantern.md` (provided in curriculum).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation exercise (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of early 20th-century Guatemala or electric lights (e.g., search “Guatemala 1930s electricity” online; free).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; story and primary source provided; substitutes (e.g., plain paper) viable.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage the student and introduce modernization.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 5: “Guatemala got free. Today, we’ll see how it got modern!”
     - Say, “Lights and cars came to Guatemala. Let’s find out how with a story and an old newspaper!”
     - Show optional images if available.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore modernization through story, primary source, dictation, and craft.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read "Maria’s New World" aloud with enthusiasm. Ask, “How would lights change your night?” to connect to the story.
     - **Primary Source (5 minutes)**: Read the newspaper clipping: "Electricity Arrives in Guatemala City! The streets are now lit with electric lights, and soon, every home will have this modern convenience." Ask, “How do you think people felt about getting electricity?” (Expect answers like “Happy” or “Excited”).
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice spelling and reinforce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Say, “Let’s write a sentence from Maria’s story.”
         - Dictate the sentence: "The lights came on." (English) or "Las luces se encendieron." (Spanish).
         - Read it slowly, repeating as needed, while the student writes it in their notebook or on paper.
         - Check their spelling and praise their effort (e.g., “You spelled ‘lights’ great!”).
     - **Craft (10 minutes)**: Follow the craft guide: Cut and fold paper into a lantern, glue tissue paper inside, decorate. Say, “This lantern shows the new lights Maria saw!”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about Maria’s story” or “What did the newspaper say about electricity?”
     - Encourage simple sentences (e.g., “Lights came to town”). Note a key idea (e.g., “Electricity made life easier”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Guatemala got modern with electricity, making life brighter.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll learn about peace after a big fight!”
     - Add a lantern drawing to the timeline’s Modern section.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling**: Listen to "Maria’s New World" to understand modernization (10 minutes).
  - **Primary Source Engagement**: Discuss the newspaper clipping to grasp electricity’s impact (5 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to the story (5 minutes).
  - **Crafting**: Make a paper lantern to symbolize technological change (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Story**: Listen for narration details (e.g., lights, excitement) to assess comprehension.
  - **Primary Source**: Check responses to the question about feelings to gauge understanding.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of “came” or “encendieron”).
  - **Craft**: Observe connection (e.g., tissue as light) to evaluate engagement.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the dictation sentence and lantern for the portfolio, assessing participation and historical link informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 6 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate extra changes (e.g., “People worked at night”) or add lantern details (e.g., street design); write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to “What did Maria see?”; pre-cut lantern pieces; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Hold the lantern and “turn it on” while narrating.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to reinforce story and craft concepts.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min story, 5 min primary source, 5 min dictation, 10 min craft)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 50 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include dictation without reducing other sections)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening, cutting, and writing skills (with help); independence from Unit 5.
- **Parent**: Ability to read aloud, assist with craft, and conduct dictation; no historical expertise required.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Print or load the story; gather craft supplies (~5-10 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Read story and clipping, dictate the sentence clearly, help with craft, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Discuss, “What would you do with electricity?”
- **Follow-Up**: Store the dictation sentence and lantern in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge text or use bold markers; describe images aloud if used.
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut lantern pieces; assist with writing or assembly; use large paper.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten story to 7 minutes or craft to 8 minutes with a break.
- **Language Support**: Use “luces/lights” and “encendieron/came on” bilingually; allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes craft supply access; substitutes (e.g., plain paper) viable.
- Requires adult help for scissors; pre-cut if unavailable.
- Assumes Unit 5 context; recap independence briefly if missed.
