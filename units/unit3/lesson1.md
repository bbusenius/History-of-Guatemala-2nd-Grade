# Unit 3, Lesson 1: Spanish Arrival in Guatemala: Pedro de Alvarado and Tecun Uman

## Overview
This lesson explores the encounter between Pedro de Alvarado, a Spanish conquistador, and Tecun Uman, a courageous Maya leader, during the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. Designed for a 7-year-old in San Juan del Obispo, near Antigua, it builds on Lesson 1’s introduction to the Spanish arrival by focusing on these two figures. Through a Wikipedia page exploration, a video, readings from Spanish and Maya perspectives, and a narration activity, the student will gain insight into this historical event, fostering empathy and cultural understanding.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books and Primary Sources**: Uses excerpts from Bartolomé de las Casas and "Título C'oyoi" for authentic narratives.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling to reinforce learning and empathy.
- **Short Lessons**: Breaks activities into 5-20 minute segments for focus.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Balances Spanish and Maya viewpoints.
- **Hands-On Engagement**: Includes visual and discussion elements to engage the student.

## Learning Objectives
1. Identify Pedro de Alvarado as a Spanish leader and Tecun Uman as a Maya leader who resisted him.
2. Retell the story of their encounter in simple terms.
3. Understand Tecun Uman’s connection to the K'iche' Maya king K'iq'ab'.
4. Reflect on the impact of the conquest on the Maya people.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Book**:*The Maya* by Anita Ganeri (English, ebook on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Maya-Ancient-Civilizations-Anita-Ganeri-ebook/dp/B00H7J9K8S), ~$7) or [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3409127M/Ancient_Maya).
- **Wikipedia Page**: [Pedro de Alvarado's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado#Conquest_of_Soconusco_and_Guatemala) (picture, first paragraph, and “Conquest of Guatemala” section).
- **Video**: [La conquista de Guatemala: la historia de Pedro de Alvarado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FvVdIKhkdM) (20 minutes).
- **Primary Source (Spanish Perspective)**: *On the Province and Kingdom of Guatemala* from *An account, much abbreviated, of the destruction of the Indies, with related texts* by Bartolomé de las Casas (pages 38-43) [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL957329W/An_account_much_abbreviated_of_the_destruction_of_the_Indies_with_related_texts) or the [Simplified version](resources/Bartolome_de_las_Casas_Simplified.md)
  - The simplified version is more appropriate for a 7-year-old but this too goes hard. Both the original and the simplified version go hard. Don't use with students who are not ready for that.
- **Primary Source (Maya Perspective)**: Excerpt from "Título C'oyoi" in *Quichean civilization: the ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and archaeological sources* by Robert M. Carmack (pages 301-304). Be sure to emphasize Título C'oyoi page 39 where Pedro de Alvarado kills Tecun Uman. In the beginning of the reading where Tecun Uman is introduced, be sure to emphasize that Tecun Uman was the grandson of the K'iche' Maya king K'iq'ab' (spelled Q'uik'ab) in the text. [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL5704779M/Quichean_civilization).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For narration notes (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of Tecun Uman (e.g., search “Tecun Uman for kids” online; free).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add a drawing of the battle.
