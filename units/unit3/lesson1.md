# Unit 3, Lesson 1: Spanish Arrival in Guatemala

### Overview
This lesson introduces the Spanish arrival in Guatemala, marking the colonial period’s start, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum for a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo. Through storytelling with a living book excerpt, picture study, dictation, coloring, and a discussion question reflecting Maya perspectives, the student explores the Spanish-Maya encounter. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books, and hands-on activities—it connects to local heritage near Antigua, fostering cultural sensitivity by considering indigenous viewpoints alongside colonial narratives.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses *The Maya* or *Popol Vuh* excerpts for narrative depth, bringing history to life authentically.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling and discussion to enhance comprehension and empathy.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments activities (e.g., 5-minute picture study) for focus.
- **Picture Study**: Includes a colonial painting to develop observation and cultural context.
- **Hands-On**: Features coloring to engage kinesthetic learners.
- **Dictation**: Links writing to historical content for meaningful practice.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Adds a Maya perspective question to balance narratives and respect indigenous views.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand that the Spanish arrived in Guatemala in the early 16th century, initiating the colonial period.
2. Retell key elements of the Spanish arrival story.
3. Observe and describe features of a colonial painting (e.g., colors, objects).
4. Write a dictated sentence about the arrival with correct spelling.
5. Reflect on how the Maya might have felt about the Spanish through a discussion question.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Living Book**: A 5-10 minute excerpt from:
  - *The Maya* by Anita Ganeri (English, ebook on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Maya-Ancient-Civilizations-Anita-Ganeri-ebook/dp/B00H7J9K8S), ~$7), focusing on Spanish contact.
  - *Popol Vuh* trans. Allen J. Christenson (Spanish/English, ebook on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Popol-Vuh-Sacred-Book-Maya-ebook/dp/B00B9I2H0G), ~$10), on cultural shifts). Sourcing details in `overview/parent_guide.md`.
- **Picture Study Image**: A colonial painting of the Spanish arrival (e.g., “The Conquest of Guatemala,” search “Spanish conquest Guatemala painting” on Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org, free use).
- **Dictation Sentence**: "The Spanish came to Guatemala by ship." (English) or "Los españoles llegaron a Guatemala en barco." (Spanish), from *The Maya*.
- **Coloring Page**: Colonial scene from `units/unit3/resources/colonial_coloring_page.md` (printable or hand-drawn).
- **Crayons or Colored Pencils**: For coloring (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Spanish ship images (e.g., search “Spanish galleon for kids” online; free).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf`.
- **Accessibility**: Ebooks prioritized; coloring page drawable if no printer; low-cost materials.

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Set the stage and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 2: “The Maya lived here first. Today, new people arrive!”
     - Say, “The Spanish came by ship long ago. We’ll hear their story and think about the Maya too!”
     - Show optional ship images.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the encounter through narrative and activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Read a 5-10 minute excerpt from *The Maya* (e.g., Spanish contact) or *Popol Vuh* (e.g., cultural shift). Ask, “What did the Spanish do when they arrived?”
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the painting. Say, “Look for 2 minutes. Notice people and things.” After, cover it and ask, “What did you see?” Then, uncover and discuss: “Who’s in this picture? What are they doing?”
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Say, “Let’s write how the Spanish got here.” Dictate "The Spanish came to Guatemala by ship." (English) or "Los españoles llegaron a Guatemala en barco." (Spanish) slowly. Check spelling and praise effort.
     - **Coloring (10 minutes)**: Provide the coloring page. Say, “Color this colonial town—like where the Spanish landed!” Ask, “What buildings do you see?”
3. **Narration and Discussion (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect on learning and Maya perspectives.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “What happened when the Spanish came?” Listen for story details (e.g., “They came on ships”).
     - Ask, “How do you think the Maya felt when the Spanish arrived?” Encourage empathy (e.g., “Scared” or “Curious”). Suggest, “Think how you’d feel if strangers came to our town.”
     - Note a key response (e.g., “The Maya were surprised”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The Spanish changed Guatemala, and the Maya had their own feelings about it.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll see how people lived after they came!”
     - Add a ship sketch to the timeline’s Colonial section.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Listening to a narrative about the Spanish arrival.
  - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Observing a colonial painting.
  - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence about the arrival.
  - **Coloring (10 minutes)**: Coloring a colonial scene.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Check narration for details (e.g., ships, Spanish) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “Men with hats”) for detail.
  - **Dictation**: Verify spelling accuracy (e.g., “ship” or “barco” correct).
  - **Discussion**: Note empathy in responses (e.g., “The Maya were scared”) to assess perspective-taking.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect dictation and coloring for the portfolio, assessing participation and connection informally (no rubric; based on effort and inclusion of key ideas).
  - In Week 10, review timeline for Unit 3 connection.

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate extra details (e.g., “They built towns”); label coloring page elements.
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to “Who came?”; pre-color parts of the page.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out ships landing during narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Use ship images to inspire coloring.

### Time Estimates
