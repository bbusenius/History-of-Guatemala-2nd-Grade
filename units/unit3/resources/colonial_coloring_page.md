# Colonial Coloring Page

## Overview
This resource provides instructions for sourcing or creating a coloring page depicting a colonial scene in Guatemala, used in Unit 3, Lesson 1: Spanish Arrival in Guatemala, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Designed for a 7-year-old, the activity helps visualize colonial life (e.g., buildings or streets from the Spanish period) following the arrival narrative. It supports hands-on learning and integrates with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods by connecting art to historical understanding, requiring minimal preparation for homeschool parents in San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The coloring page supports educational goals by:
- Integrating art with history to reinforce the colonial period’s visual aspects.
- Enhancing fine motor skills and creativity, aligning with cross-subject goals (art).
- Encouraging narration about colonial life, supporting Charlotte Mason’s oral expression focus.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this coloring page, the student will be able to:
1. Visualize a colonial scene representative of Guatemala post-Spanish arrival (e.g., a church or street).
2. Color the scene accurately, connecting it to the historical context of Lesson 1.
3. Describe the colored scene during narration, linking it to the Spanish arrival story.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Coloring Page**: A printable colonial scene sourced online or hand-drawn by the parent.
  - **Source Option 1**: Search online for “colonial Antigua coloring page” or “Spanish colonial scene for kids” on educational sites (e.g., free printables from teacher resources or coloring sites).
  - **Source Option 2**: Parent draws a simple scene on blank paper (e.g., a colonial church like Catedral de San José, a cobblestone street, people in period clothing).
- **Crayons or Colored Pencils**: For coloring (household items or ~$2-$5 if purchased).
- **Printer and Paper**: If using an online printable (household or library access; standard 8.5x11 paper).
- **Optional Reference**: Images of colonial Antigua (e.g., search “Antigua Guatemala colonial architecture” online; free).
- **Accessibility**: Free with internet access or drawing supplies; minimal cost if purchasing crayons.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (10-15 minutes, pre-lesson)**:
   - **Option 1: Online Search**: Search for a free printable (e.g., “colonial Antigua coloring page”) on a site like a teacher resource page or coloring website. Download and print one page showing a colonial scene (e.g., church, street). Consider [this example](https://colorconfetti.com/img/guatemala-coloring-page-w3.png)
   - **Option 2: Hand-Draw**: On blank paper, sketch a simple colonial scene (e.g., a church with a bell tower, cobblestone path, a person in a hat). Use clear, bold outlines suitable for coloring.
   - Optionally, gather reference images online to guide drawing or discuss during coloring.
2. **Introduction (5 minutes, during Lesson 1)**:
   - After reading "The Day the Ships Came," say, “This picture shows what a town looked like after the Spanish came. Let’s color it!”
   - Show the coloring page and connect it to the story (e.g., “This could be where the Spanish built their camp”).
3. **Coloring Activity (15 minutes, during Lesson 1)**:
   - Provide the coloring page and crayons. Guide the student to color key elements (e.g., “Make the church yellow like old buildings” or “What color would the street be?”).
   - Discuss while coloring: “Who might live in this town? What buildings do you see?”
4. **Review and Narration (10 minutes, during Lesson 1)**:
   - As part of Lesson 1 narration, ask, “What’s happening in your picture?” or “Tell me about this town.”
   - Encourage links to the story (e.g., “The Spanish made houses like this”).

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Color the colonial scene during Lesson 1’s main activity (15 minutes), following the storytelling segment, to visualize the Spanish arrival’s impact.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement and creativity in coloring; listen for historical connections in narration (e.g., mentions Spanish buildings or people).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the colored page for the portfolio, assessing participation and understanding of colonial life informally (no rubric; based on effort and narration content).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add labels to the scene (e.g., “church,” “Spanish house”) or draw additional details (e.g., a horse).
- **Struggling Learners**: Focus on coloring one element (e.g., the church); assist with crayon use if needed.
- **Visual Learners**: Use reference images to guide color choices (e.g., “Colonial buildings were often white or yellow”).
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Encourage pointing to parts of the scene while narrating.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 10-15 minutes (sourcing or drawing the page)
- Introduction: 5 minutes (within Lesson 1)
- Coloring: 15 minutes (within Lesson 1’s main activity)
- Review/Narration: 10 minutes (within Lesson 1)
- Total: 30 minutes (integrated into Lesson 1’s 45-minute structure)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring skills; familiarity with the Spanish arrival from the Lesson 1 story.
- **Parent**: Ability to source a printable online or draw a basic scene (no advanced art skills needed).

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Find or draw the coloring page before Lesson 1; gather crayons.
- **Facilitation**: Present the page after the story, guide coloring, and prompt discussion during the activity.
- **Engagement**: Discuss the scene (e.g., “What do you think people did here?”) to deepen understanding.
- **Follow-Up**: Store the finished page in the portfolio after narration.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Enlarge the printable or draw with thick, bold lines; describe the scene aloud (e.g., “This is a church with a tower”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with coloring or provide a simpler scene (e.g., just a building outline); use large crayons.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten coloring to 10 minutes, focusing on one key feature (e.g., the church).
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “iglesia/church,” “calle/street”) to reinforce vocabulary.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to internet or drawing supplies; a hand-drawn page suffices if no printer is available.
- Relies on parent prep time; a quick sketch works if time is limited.
- Assumes integration with Lesson 1’s story; if used separately, provide a brief Spanish arrival context.
