# Colonial Window Craft

## Overview
This resource provides instructions for a hands-on craft to create a paper colonial window, used in Unit 3, Lesson 2: Colonial Life in Guatemala, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Designed for a 7-year-old, the craft reflects colonial architecture (e.g., windows in Antigua’s churches or homes), deepening understanding of colonial life through creativity. It aligns with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods by combining art with historical exploration, requiring minimal preparation for parents in San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The craft supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding of colonial architecture through a tangible project.
- Enhancing fine motor skills and creativity, aligning with cross-subject goals (art).
- Encouraging narration about colonial life, supporting Charlotte Mason’s oral expression focus.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this craft, the student will be able to:
1. Recognize colonial windows as a feature of Spanish-influenced buildings in Guatemala.
2. Create a paper window with a frame and “stained glass” using simple materials.
3. Describe their window’s imagined setting or purpose during narration (e.g., “It’s in a big church”).

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Construction Paper**: Brown or white for the window frame (household item or ~$5/pack).
- **Tissue Paper**: Any color for “glass” (household or ~$2/pack).
- **Markers**: For decoration (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Scissors**: For cutting the frame and panes (household; adult supervision required).
- **Glue**: To attach tissue paper (household or ~$1).
- **Optional Reference**: Images of colonial windows (e.g., search “Antigua Guatemala colonial windows” online; free).
- **Accessibility**: Uses low-cost, common materials; substitutes (e.g., plain paper for construction paper, pencils for markers) work if needed.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (5-10 minutes, pre-lesson)**:
   - Gather construction paper, tissue paper, markers, scissors, and glue.
   - Optionally, search online for images of colonial windows (e.g., from Antigua) to show as examples.
2. **Introduction (5 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - Say, “The Spanish built houses and churches with pretty windows. Today, we’ll make one like they had!”
   - Show optional images and point out features (e.g., “See the frame and colored glass?”).
3. **Craft Activity (25 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - **Step 1: Cut the Frame**: Use construction paper to cut a rectangular frame (e.g., 6x8 inches).
   - **Step 2: Add Panes**: With adult help, cut 4 smaller squares inside the frame (e.g., 2x2 inches each) to create window panes.
   - **Step 3: Attach Glass**: Cut tissue paper into pieces to fit behind each pane; glue them to the back of the frame for a “stained glass” effect.
   - **Step 4: Decorate**: Use markers to draw details on the frame (e.g., curtains, flowers, or colonial patterns).
   - Discuss while crafting: “What might you see through this window? People walking or a market?”
4. **Review and Narration (10 minutes, during Lesson 2)**:
   - Ask, “What does your window look like?” or “Tell me a story about what’s outside it.”
   - Encourage imaginative responses tied to colonial life (e.g., “Spanish people live here”).

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Create the colonial window during Lesson 2’s main activity (25 minutes), exploring colonial architecture hands-on.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe effort and creativity in crafting; listen for narration connections (e.g., mentions colonial buildings or daily life).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the craft for the portfolio, assessing participation and understanding of colonial features informally (no rubric; based on effort and narration).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add more panes (e.g., 6) or detailed designs; narrate a complex scene (e.g., “A priest looks out”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-cut the frame and panes; focus on gluing tissue paper and simple marker lines.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out looking through the window or hold it up to “see” a scene.
- **Visual Learners**: Use reference images to inspire decoration (e.g., “Make it like this church window”).

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 5-10 minutes (gathering materials)
- Introduction: 5 minutes (within Lesson 2)
- Crafting: 25 minutes (within Lesson 2’s main activity)
- Review/Narration: 10 minutes (within Lesson 2)
- Total: 40 minutes (fits Lesson 2’s 45-minute structure)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic cutting and gluing skills (with help); familiarity with the Spanish arrival from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to supervise scissors and assist with assembly; no craft expertise needed.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Collect materials before Lesson 2; optionally find reference images.
- **Facilitation**: Assist with cutting the frame/panes, guide gluing and decorating, and prompt discussion during crafting.
- **Engagement**: Ask questions like “Where could this window be?” to deepen historical connection.
- **Follow-Up**: Store the finished craft in the portfolio after narration.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use high-contrast colors (e.g., dark frame, bright tissue); describe steps aloud (e.g., “Glue the red tissue here”).
- **Motor Challenges**: Pre-cut all shapes; assist with gluing or use larger paper for easier handling.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten crafting to 15-20 minutes, focusing on frame and glass; finish decoration later if needed.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “ventana/window,” “vidrio/glass”) to reinforce vocabulary.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic craft supplies; plain paper and pencils can substitute if construction paper or markers are unavailable.
- Requires adult supervision for scissors; pre-cut shapes if no adult help is available, or draw panes instead of cutting.
- Assumes integration with Lesson 2; if standalone, provide a brief colonial life intro.
