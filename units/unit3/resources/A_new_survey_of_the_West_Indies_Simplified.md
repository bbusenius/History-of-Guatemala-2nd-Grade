I need you to rewrite this for a 7-year-old following these requirements:
- Though this is for a 7-year-old, the writing doesn't need to be overly juvenile. Since this will be read to the student, it can be 4-5 reading levels above the typical 7-year-old reading level.
- There is no reason to sanitize or censor the events that take place in this excerpt. This is for a history class and we do not need to "protect" the child from reality.

We then followed up with this prompt:

OK, that was quite good. I appreciate that you preserved the vibrant descriptions and geography. I want to be sure that you're paraphrasing the author when you say things like "unfair". We don't need to inject our opinion into this. We should remain true to what the original author wrote. Let's keep all of the vibrant descriptions and geography, but let's try another version that will be a little longer and provide more specifics about the treatment of the indigenous and slaves. Also, you kept graphic details out. Well, we don't need to go into immense detail, however, some "graphic details" should be included. We are teaching real history and these were brutal times. We need to be honest about that, even to a 7-year-old.

# Guatemala Long Ago: A Land of Beauty and Hard Times

Hundreds of years ago, in a place called Guatemala, there was a dazzling city tucked in a narrow valley. Tall, green mountains stood all around, like giants holding up the sky. The valley was only a few miles wide but stretched long and lush toward the sea. The Spanish people who lived there named the city Santiago de Guatemala, and sometimes they called it Santiago de los Caballeros to make it sound extra fancy, like a city for knights. We’ll call it Antigua Guatemala for short, because that’s what people call it today.

## Mountains of Fire and Water

Two incredible mountains watched over the valley. One was called the "volcano of water," and the other was the "volcano of fire." They were like two very different brothers! The volcano of water was covered in green fields where people grew corn, wheat, and beans. If you climbed to its top, you could see forever, almost touching the fluffy clouds! Clear springs bubbled up from this mountain, sending water down into a river that flowed past the city. That river was busy—it turned big wooden wheels that crushed wheat into flour for bread. The Spanish told a scary story about this volcano. They said that long ago, a huge flood of water poured down from it, smashing part of the old city. They even whispered about a woman who was so angry that she shouted at God, and the flood swept her away with her house!
Across the valley was the volcano of fire. This mountain was wild and rocky, not green like its neighbor. It grumbled and smoked, and sometimes it roared, spitting out flames and ash into the sky. At night, the fire glowed so bright that you could stand miles away and read a letter by its light! When the wind blew, the volcano’s rumbles sounded like a giant lion. The people in the city were amazed by it, but they also stayed careful, knowing it could be dangerous. Still, the city was safe most of the time, nestled between these two mighty mountains.

## A City Full of Life

Antigua Guatemala was a busy place. The Spanish had built grand houses, wide streets, and big churches with silver lamps and colorful paintings. The churches were so tall they seemed to touch the sky, and on special days, bells rang out, calling everyone to pray. The Spanish grew rich here, owning huge farms outside the city where they raised cows, sheep, goats, and pigs. They also grew sugar, wheat, and fruits like bananas, apricots, and cacao for chocolate. The markets were bursting with food—fish from the rivers, deer and rabbits from the forests, and all kinds of fruits and vegetables.

But the land wasn’t just home to the Spanish. Long before they arrived, indigenous people lived here. They were skilled farmers and builders who knew the land like their own hands. They grew corn and beans and built homes in the valleys and hills. When the Spanish came, they took over, and life changed for the indigenous people. The Spanish also brought people from Africa, taken from their homes and forced to work as slaves. These enslaved people had no freedom and faced a hard life, far from their families.

## The Hard Lives of Indigenous People

Thomas Gage, the man who wrote about this time, saw how the Spanish treated the indigenous people. He said they were made to work very hard, often with little rest. The Spanish forced them to carry heavy loads, like sacks of grain or wood, on their backs, sometimes walking for miles. Gage wrote that their bodies grew tired and sore from this work. They were paid very little—sometimes just a few coins or a bit of food. The Spanish leaders, called encomenderos, were given control over whole villages of indigenous people. These leaders made them work on farms or in the city, and if they didn’t work fast enough, they could be whipped or punished. Gage said some indigenous people were so worn out that they felt hopeless, and some even died from the hard labor or sicknesses brought by the Spanish.

The indigenous people loved their families and their land, but the Spanish took away much of their freedom. They had to give the Spanish part of their crops, like corn or beans, as a tax. If they couldn’t pay, they might be beaten or lose their homes. Gage noticed that some indigenous people tried to keep their old ways, like praying to their own gods, but the Spanish forced them to follow the Christian religion. They had to go to church and learn Spanish prayers, even if they didn’t understand them. On special church days, the Spanish made them bring gifts, like chickens or cloth, which left them with less for their own families.

## The Suffering of Enslaved Africans

The enslaved Africans faced even harsher treatment, according to Gage. They were brought to Guatemala on big ships, packed so tightly they could hardly move, and many got sick or died on the way. Once in the city, they were sold like animals to Spanish farmers or city people. Gage wrote that they worked from sunrise to sunset, doing the toughest jobs. Some carried heavy loads or dug in the fields under the hot sun. Others cleaned houses or took care of animals. If they made a mistake or worked too slowly, they could be whipped until their backs bled, or chained up so they couldn’t run away. Gage saw how their bodies were scarred from these punishments.

The enslaved Africans had no choice in their lives. They couldn’t go home, see their families, or decide what to do. Gage said they lived in small, cramped huts with little food—sometimes just a bit of bread or corn. They were treated like property, not people, and the Spanish didn’t care about their pain. Some tried to escape, but if they were caught, the punishments were even worse, like being whipped or having their feet locked in heavy chains. Despite this, Gage noticed that some enslaved people sang songs from their homeland, trying to keep their spirits strong.

## A Land of Riches and Rules

The Spanish in Antigua lived very differently. They had a big court where a leader called the President made rules. This court was full of rich men who wore fancy clothes and lived in huge houses. They made money from the farms, the markets, and the hard work of the indigenous people and slaves. Gage said these leaders sometimes took extra money from the workers, keeping it for themselves. They also sold things like sugar and cloth to other countries, getting even richer.

The churches were a big part of life, too. The Spanish built them to teach everyone about their God. Indigenous people and even some enslaved Africans went to these churches, but the Spanish priests often asked for money or gifts. Gage saw that the priests and leaders worked together to keep the Spanish in charge, while the indigenous people and slaves had to follow their rules.

## A Beautiful but Hard Place

Guatemala back then was a land of wonders. The green valley, the fiery volcano, the rushing river, and the busy markets made it a place full of life. But it was also a place of suffering. The indigenous people worked until their bodies ached, carrying heavy loads and giving up their crops. The enslaved Africans faced whips, chains, and endless work, far from their homes. Thomas Gage saw all this and wrote it down so people would know what life was like. The Spanish lived richly, but their riches came from the pain of others. It was a time when beauty and cruelty lived side by side in Guatemala.
