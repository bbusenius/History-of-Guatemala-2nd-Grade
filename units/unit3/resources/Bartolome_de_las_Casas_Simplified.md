# The Spanish in Guatemala: A Story from Bartolomé de las Casas

Long ago, in the land we now call Guatemala, a Spanish leader named Pedro de Alvarado arrived in the Kingdom of Guatimala. Bartolomé de las Casas, a man who lived during this time, wrote about what happened. He saw some of these events himself and heard other stories from people who were there. His words tell a sad and difficult story about how the Spanish treated the people who lived in Guatimala.

When Pedro de Alvarado first came, he and his men killed many people as they entered the land. The people of Utatlan, the main city, welcomed him with joy. Their leader, carried on a special platform, came with music, drums, and food to share. They gave the Spanish everything they could, hoping to be kind. But the Spanish set up camp outside the city, worried it might be dangerous inside.

The next day, Alvarado called the main leader and other important people to meet him. When they arrived, trusting him, he captured them. He demanded they give him a lot of gold. The leaders explained that their land had no gold, but Alvarado didn’t believe them. He ordered them to be burned alive, without a fair trial or any proof they did wrong. When other leaders in the area heard that their main leader was killed just for not having gold, they were afraid. They left their homes and hid in the wilderness. They told their people to serve the Spanish but not to tell where they had gone.

The people went to the Spanish, saying they would work for them and be loyal. But Alvarado was cruel. He said he wouldn’t accept their service and threatened to burn them all unless they told him where their leaders were. The people said they didn’t know, and they offered to serve with their families. But the Spanish went to their villages, where people were working or resting with their families, and attacked them. They stabbed them with spears and swords, even children and elders, leaving almost nothing of some villages. The people ran, but many couldn’t escape.

The people saw that no matter how much they tried to please the Spanish, they were still attacked for no reason. They decided to fight back, knowing they were weak compared to the Spanish, who had horses and weapons. They dug holes in the roads with sharp sticks to trap the horses, but this didn’t work for long. The Spanish, angry about this, made a rule: any person they caught would be thrown into those holes, where sharp sticks would pierce them. Women, children, and elders were thrown in, and it was a terrible sight. Others were killed with weapons or torn apart by fierce dogs. If they found a leader, they burned him in a fire. These cruel acts went on for years, from 1524 to 1530 or 1531, and Las Casas says countless people suffered.

In another place called Cuzcatlan, near where San Salvador is today, the Spanish were welcomed with a huge celebration. Thousands of people brought food, like chickens, to share. But Alvarado told his men to take as many people as they wanted to serve them. Each Spanish soldier took many people to work for them, and the people did their best to please them. Then Alvarado demanded gold. The people brought copper axes that looked like gold, but when he tested them and saw they weren’t gold, he was furious. He told his men to put the people they had taken into chains to be slaves. When the people saw this and heard about it, they began to fight back. The Spanish attacked them fiercely and caused great destruction. Later, they built a city in Guatimala, but Las Casas says it was later destroyed by floods and disasters, as if it was a punishment.

Alvarado also forced the people he had already conquered to fight against others. He took thousands of them to war but didn’t give them food. He allowed them to take what they needed from the people they captured, and Las Casas heard that terrible things happened in his camp, causing great fear. Other people in nearby lands learned of these cruel acts and were so scared they didn’t know where to hide.

Alvarado made people carry heavy loads, like anchors and cannons, over long distances. Many suffered and died from exhaustion. He took wives and daughters from their families to give to his soldiers and sailors. He filled ships with people, where they died of hunger and thirst. Las Casas says these cruel acts caused so much pain—families were torn apart, people lost their freedom, and many cried and suffered. He says millions died in Guatimala and nearby lands between 1524 and 1540, and the suffering continued.

Las Casas wrote this to show the world how cruel Pedro de Alvarado and his men were, based on what he saw and what others told him. He hoped people would see the truth about what happened in Guatimala and how so many lives were lost.
