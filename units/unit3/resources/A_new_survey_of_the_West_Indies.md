Thus with full and ample commission from the Bishop and the Provincial was I settled in Guatemala, to read and preach, where (although I might have continued many years and was offered to read divinity, having in part begun it one quarter of a year) I continued yet but three years and almost an half for the reason I shall show hereafter. So what in that time I could observe of that city, and of the country round about, having had occasions to travel about it both when I lived in Guatemala, and afterwards when I lived for above seven years in the country towns, I shall truly and faithfully recommend unto my Reader.

This city of Guatemala (called by the Spaniards Santiago, or St James of Guatemala) is seated in a valley, which is not above two miles and a half broad, for the high mountains do keep it close in; but in length towards the South Sea it continues a wide and champaign country, opening itself broader a little beyond that town, which to this day is called la Ciudad Vieja, or the Old City, standing somewhat above three miles from Guatemala. Though the mountains on each side do strongly environ it, and especially on the east side seem to hang over it, yet none of them are hinderers to travellers, who over them have opened ways easy for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts. The way from Mexico, if taken by the coast of Soconusco and Suchitepequez, comes into the city north-westward, which is a wide, open, and sandy road; if it be taken by Chiapa, it lieth north-east, and entereth into the city between the mountains, as before hath been noted. Westward to the South Sea the way lieth open through the valley and a champaign country. But south or south-east, the entrance is over high and steepy hills, which is the common road from Comayagua, Nicaragua, and the Golfo Dulce or sweet gulf, where the ships come yearly and unlade all the commodities which are brought from Spain for Guatemala. This also is the way followed by them who take a journey more eastward from this city.

But the chiefest mountains which straighten in this city and valley are two, called volcanoes, the one being a volcano of water, and the other a volcano or mountain of fire, termed so by the Spaniards, though very improperly a volcano may be said to contain water, it taking its name from the heathenish God Vulcan, whose profession and employment chiefly was in fire. These two famous mountains stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the valley; that of water hanging on the south side almost perpendicularly over the city, the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old city. That of water is higher than the other, and yields a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the year green, and full of Indian milpas, which are plantations of Indian wheat; and in the small and petty towns which lie some half way up it, some at the foot of it, there are roses, lilies, and other flowers all the year long in the gardens, besides plantains, apricots, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits. It is called by the Spaniards, el volcán del agua, or the volcano of water, because on the other side of it from Guatemala it springs with many brooks towards a town called Saint Christopher, and especially is thought to preserve and nourish on that side also a great lake of fresh water, by the towns called Amatitlán and Petapa. But on the side of it towards Guatemala and the valley it yields also so many springs of sweet and fresh water as have caused and made a river which runneth along the valley close by the city, and is that which drives the water-mills spoken of before in Xocotenango. This river was not known when first the Spaniards conquered that country; but since (according to their constant tradition) the city of Guatemala standing higher and nearer to the volcano in that place and town which to this day is called la Ciudad Vieja, or the Old City, there lived in it then about the year 1534 a gentlewoman called Doña Maria de Camilla, who having lost her husband in the wars, and that same year buried also all her children, grew so impatient under these her crosses and afflictions, that impiously she defied God, saying: ‘What can God do more unto me now than he hath done? He hath done his worst without it be to take away my life also, which I now regard not.’ Upon these words there gushed out of this volcano such a flood of water as carried away this woman with the stream, ruined many of the houses, and caused the inhabitants to remove to the place where now standeth Guatemala. This is the Spaniards’ own tradition, which if true, should be our example to learn to fear and not to defy God, when his judgments show him to us angry and a God that will overcome, when he judgeth. From that time, and from this their tradition is the town now standing, where first stood Guatemala, called la Ciudad Vieja, or the Old City, and hath continued a river which before was not known, having its head and spring from this high volcano, whose pleasant springs, gardens, fruits, flowers and every green and flourishing prospect might be a fair object to a Martial’s wit, who here would fancy a new Parnassus, find out new steps of flying Pegasus, and greet the nymphs and Nine Sisters with this their never yet discovered and American habitation.

This volcano or mountain is not so pleasing to the sight (whose height is judged full nine miles unto the top) but the other which standeth on the other side of the valley opposite unto it is unpleasing and more dreadful to behold; for here are ashes for beauty, stones and flints for fruits and flowers, baldness for greenness, barrenness for fruitfulness, for water whisperings and fountain murmurs, noise of thunders and roaring of consuming metals, for running streams, flashings of fire, for tall and mighty trees and cedars, castles of smoke rising in height to out-dare the sky and firmament, for sweet and odoriferous and fragrant smells, a stink of fire and brimstone, which are still in action striving within the bowels of that ever burning and fiery volcano. Thus is Guatemala seated in the midst of a Paradise on the one side and a hell on the other, yet never hath this hell broke so loose as to consume that flourishing city. True it is formerly many years ago it opened a wide mouth on the top, and breathed out such fiery ashes as filled the houses of Guatemala and the country about, and parched all the plants and fruits, and spewed out such stones and rocks which had they fallen upon the city would have crushed it to pieces, but they fell not far from it, but to this day lie about the bottom and sides of it, causing wonder to those that behold them, and taking away admiration from them that admire the force and strength of fire and powder in carrying on a weighty bullet from the mouth of a cannon, whereas here the fire of this mountain hath cast up into the air and tumbled down to the bottom of it such rocks as in bigness exceed a reasonable house, and which not the strength of any twenty mules (as hath been tried) have been able to remove. The fire which flasheth out of the top of this mountain is sometimes more and sometimes less; yet while I lived in the city, on a certain time for the space of three or four days and nights it did so burn that my friend Mr Cabañas confidently avouched to me and others, that standing one night in his window he had with the light of that fire read a letter, the distance being above three English miles. The roaring also of this monstrous beast is not constantly alike, but is greater in the summer time than in the winter, that is, from October to the end of April, than all the rest of the year; for then it seems, the winds entering into those concavities set the fire on work harder than at other times, and cause the mountain to roar and the earth about to quake. There was a time, three years before my coming to that city, when the inhabitants expected nothing but utter ruin and destruction, and durst not abide within their houses for nine days (the earthquakes continuing and increasing more and more) but made bowers and arbours in the market-place, placing there their idol saints and images, especially St Sebastian, whom they hoped would deliver them from that judgment, and for this purpose they daily carried him through the streets in solemn and idolatrous procession and adoration. But all the while I lived there the noise within the mountain, the smoke and flashes of fire without, and the summer earthquakes were such that with the use and custom of them I never feared anything, but thought that city the healthiest and pleasantest place of dwelling that ever I came into in all my travels.

The climate is very temperate, far exceeding either Mexico or Oaxaca. Neither are the two aforementioned cities better stored with fruits, herbs for salad, provision of fish, and flesh, beef, mutton, veal, kid, fowls, turkeys, rabbits, quails, partridges, pheasants, and of Indian and Spanish wheat than is this city: from the South Sea (which lieth in some places not above twelve leagues from it) and from the rivers of the South Sea Coast, and from the fresh lake of Amatitlán and Petapa, and from another lake lying three or four leagues from Chimaltenango, it is well and plentifully provided for of fish. But for beef there is such plenty that it exceeds all parts of America, without exception, as may be known by the hides, which are sent yearly to Spain from the country of Guatemala, where they commonly kill their cattle, more for the gain of their hides in Spain, than for the goodness or fatness of the flesh, which though it be not to be compared to our English beef, yet it is good man’s meat, and so cheap, that in my time it was commonly sold at thirteen pound and a half for half a real, the least coin there, and as much as threepence here. Though all about this country there are very great and spacious estancias, or farms for breeding only, even near to the Golfo Dulce, where the ships ride that come from Spain, yet from Comayagua, St Salvador and Nicaragua is Guatemala stored; but above all are the great estancias in the South Sea coast or marsh, where in my time there was a grazier that reckoned up going in his own estancia and ground, forty thousand heads of beasts, small and great, besides many which are called there cimarrones, or wild cattle, which were strayed among the woods and mountains, and could not be gathered in with the rest, but were hunted by the blackamoors like wild boars, and daily shot to death, lest they should too much increase and do hurt. Myself chanced to be present at the fair of the town of Petapa, with a friend named Lope de Chaves (who was as they call there, obligado, or charged to provide flesh for six or seven towns thereabouts), who at one bargain, and of one man, bought six thousand head of cattle, great and small, paying one with another eighteen reals, or nine English shillings a head.

The manner and custom of Guatemala for the better providing both beef and mutton for it, and the country towns about, is this. Nine days before Michaelmas, every day proclamation is made about the city for an obligado, or one that will be bound to the city and country for competent provision of flesh meat upon forfeiture of such a sum of money to his Majesty, if he fail, as shall be agreed upon between him and the court, and to the inhabitants of the city; if he fail in beef, he is to allow in mutton so many pounds at the same rate as he should have allowed beef. If the obligado fail in mutton, he is to allow in fowl flesh, so many pounds and at the same rate as he was to allow the mutton; and this with consideration of the family, what competent allowance of flesh meat shall be judged for a day, or the days that the obligado shall fail. Besides this the proclamation is made for whom offers most to his Majesty for one year’s obligation. So that sometimes it happeneth that the eight days several men come into the court, offering more and more, till upon the ninth day and last proclamation, the office is settled for one year upon him that hath offered most unto his Majesty. Thus many butchers are not allowed but one only obligado, who also is abridged to so many pound for so much money, so that if any other besides him offer to kill or sell, he may follow an action and the court against him. Thus the obligado (who commonly is a moneyed man) buyeth by the hundred or by the thousand, as for the present he findeth the expense of the city, without he be himself such a grazier as hath cattle enough of his own. Though mutton be not so plentiful as is beef, yet there never wants from the Valley of Mixco, Pinola, Petapa, and Amatitlán, and the marsh and other places. In the valley aforementioned I lived, and was well acquainted with one Alonso Capata, who had constantly going in the valley four thousand sheep. Guatemala therefore is so well stored with good provision, plentiful and cheap, that it is hard to find in it a beggar, for with half a real the poorest may buy beef for a week, and with a few cacaos they may have bread of Indian maize, if not of Spanish wheat.

This city may consist of about five thousand families, besides a suburb of Indians called el Barrio de Sto Domingo, where may be two hundred families more. The best part of the city is that which joineth to this suburb of Indians, and is called also el Barrio de Santo Domingo, by reason of the cloister of Saint Dominic which standeth in it. Here are the richest and best shops of the city, with the best buildings, most of the houses being new, and stately. Here is also a daily tianguez (as they call it) or petty market, where some Indians all the day sit selling fruits, herbs, and cacao, but at the four in the afternoon, this market is filled for a matter of an hour, where the Indian women meet to sell their country slap (which is dainties to the Creoles) as atole, pinole, scalded plantains, butter of the cacao, puddings made of Indian maize, with a bit of fowl or fresh pork in them seasoned with much red biting chilli, which they call anacatamales. The trading of the city is great, for by mules it partakes of the best commodities of Mexico, Oaxaca and Chiapa, and southward of Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. By sea it hath commerce with Peru, by two sea ports and havens, the one called La Villa de la Trinidad, the Village of the Trinity, which lieth southward from it five and twenty leagues; and by another called El Realejo, which lieth five or six and forty leagues from it. It hath traffic with Spain by the North Sea from Golfo Dulce, lying three-score leagues from it.

It is not so rich as other cities, yet for the quantity of it, it yields to none. There were in my time five (besides many other merchants who were judged worth twenty thousand ducats, thirty thousand, fifty thousand, some few a hundred thousand) who were judged of equal wealth, and generally reported to be worth each of them five hundred thousand ducats; the first was Thomas de Siliezer, a Biscayan born, and Alcalde de Corte, the King’s High Justice, or Chief Officer at Court; the second was Antonio Justiniano, a Genoese born, and one that bore often offices in the city, and had many tenements and houses, especially a great and rich farm for corn and wheat in the Valley of Mexico. The third was Pedro de Lira, born in Castile, the fourth and fifth, Antonio Fernandez, and Bartolomé Nuñez, both Portuguese, whereof the first in my time departed from Guatemala for some reasons which here I must conceal. The other four I left there, the three of them living at that end of the city called Barrio de Santo Domingo, or the Street of St Dominic, whose houses and presence makes that street excel all the rest of the city, and their wealth and trading were enough to denominate Guatemala a very rich city.

The Government of all the country about, and of all Honduras, Soconusco, Comayagua, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Vera Paz, Suchitepequez, and Chiapa, is subordinate unto the Chancery of Guatemala; for although every governor over these several provinces is appointed by the King and Council of Spain, yet when they come to those parts to the enjoyment of their charge and execution office, then their actions, if unjust, are weighed, judged, censured, and condemned by the Court residing in the city. This Court of Chancery consisteth of a president, six judges, one King’s attorney, and two chief justices of court. The President, though he have not the name and title of viceroy, as they of Mexico and Peru, yet his power is as great and absolute as theirs. His pension from the King is but twelve thousand ducats a year; but besides this, if he be covetous, he makes by bribes and trading twice as much more, nay what he list, as was seen in the Count de la Gomera, President of that city and Chancery for the space of fourteen years, who departed in old age from Guatemala to the Canaries (where was his house and place of birth) worth millions of ducats. After him succeeded Don Juan de Guzmán, formerly President of Santo Domingo, who losing his wife and lady in the way, lost also his former spirit and courage, betaking himself wholly to his devotions, contemning wealth and riches, governing with love and mildness, which made the rest of the judges, who were all for lucre, soon weary him out of his office, continuing in it but five years. His successor (whom I left there when I came away) was Don Gonzalo de Paz y Lorencana, who was promoted from the presidency of Panama to that place, and came into it with such a spirit of covetousness as the like had not been seen in any former president. He forbad all gaming in private houses in the city, which there is much used (though by women not so much as in Mexico) not for that he hated it, but because he envied others what they got and gained by their cards, drawing to himself thereby all that gain, spending sometimes in one night four and twenty pair of cards, appointing a page to assist at the tables, and to see the box well paid for every pair of cards, which for his, and his Court respect, was seldom less than a crown or two for every pair. Thus did he lick up with his cards most of the gamester’s gains, and would grudge and pick quarrels with such rich men whom he knew to affect gaming, if they frequented not his Court at night time for that bewitching recreation.

The pension which the King alloweth to every judge of Chancery is four thousand ducats yearly, and three thousand to his attorney, all which is paid out of the King’s Exchequer abiding in that city. Yet what besides they get by bribes and trading is so much, that I have heard a judge himself Don Luis de las Infantas say, that though a judge’s place at Mexico and Lima be more honourable, yet none more profitable than Guatemala. In my time were such causes at Chancery tried, as had never been, of murders, robberies, and oppressions, and whereas it was expected the offenders some should be hanged, some banished, some imprisoned, some by fines impoverished, bribes took all off, so that I never knew one hanged in that city for the space of above eight years.

The churches though they be not so fair and rich as those of Mexico, yet they are for that place wealthy enough. There is but one parish church and a cathedral which standeth in the chief market-place. All the other churches belong to cloisters, which are of Dominicans, Franciscans, Mercedarians, Augustines, and Jesuits, and two of nuns, called the Conception and St Catharine. The Dominicans, Franciscans, and Mercedarians are stately cloisters, containing near a hundred friars apiece; but above all is the cloister where I lived, of the Dominicans, to which is joined in a great walk before the church the University of the city. The yearly revenues which come into this cloister, what from the Indian towns belonging to it, what from a water-mill, what from a farm for corn, what from an estancia, or farm for horses and mules, what from an ingenio, or farm of sugar, what from a mine of silver given unto it the year 1633 are judged to be (excepting all charges) at least thirty thousand ducats; wherewith those fat friars feast themselves, and have to spare to build, and enrich their church and altars. Besides much treasure belonging to it, there are two things in it which the Spaniards in merriment would often tell me that the English nation did much enquire after, when they took any ship of theirs at sea, and that they feared I was come to spy them, which were a lamp of silver hanging before the high altar, so big as required the strength of three men to hale it up with a rope; but the other is of more value, which is a picture of the Virgin Mary of pure silver, and of the stature of a reasonable tall woman, which standeth in a tabernacle made on purpose in a Chapel of the Rosary with at least a dozen lamps of silver also burning before it. A hundred thousand ducats might soon be made up of the treasure belonging to that church and cloister. Within the walls of the cloister there is nothing wanting which may further pleasure and recreation. In the lower cloister there is a spacious garden, in the midst whereof is a fountain casting up the water, and spouting it out of at least a dozen pipes, which fill two ponds full of fishes, and with this their constant running give music to the whole cloister, and encouragement to many water-fowls and ducks to bathe and wash themselves therein. Yet further within the cloister, there are other two gardens for fruits and herbage, and in the one a pond of a quarter of a mile long, all paved at the bottom, and a low stone wall about, where is a boat for the friars’ recreation, who often go thither to fish, and do sometimes upon a sudden want or occasion take out from thence as much fish as will give to the whole cloister a dinner.

The other cloisters of the city are also rich; but next to the Dominicans is the cloister of nuns called the Conception, in which at my time there were judged to live a thousand women, not all nuns, but nuns and their serving maids or slaves, and young children which were brought up and taught to work by the nuns. The nuns that are professed bring with them their portions, five hundred ducats the least, some six hundred, some seven, and some a thousand, which portions after a few years (and continuing to the cloister after the nuns’ decease) come to make up a great yearly rent. They that will have maids within to wait on them may, bringing the bigger portion, or allowing yearly for their servants’ diet. In this cloister lived that Doña Juana de Maldonado, Judge Juan Maldonado de Paz his daughter, whom the Bishop so much conversed withal. She was very fair and beautiful, and not much above twenty years of age, and yet his love blinding him, he strove what he could in my time against all the ancient nuns and sisters, to make her superior and abbess, and caused such a mutiny and strife in that cloister, which was very scandalous to the whole city, and made many rich merchants and gentlemen run to the cloister with their swords drawn, threatening to break in amongst the nuns to defend their daughters against the powerful faction which the Bishop had wrought for Doña Juana de Maldonado: which they had performed if the President Don Juan de Guzmán had not sent Juan Maldonado de Paz, the young nun’s father, to entreat her to desist in regard of her young age from her ambitious thoughts of being abbess. With this the mutiny both within and without ceased, the Bishop got but shame, and his young sister continued as before under command and obedience, to a more religious, grave, and aged nun than herself.

This Doña Juana de Maldonado y Paz was the wonder of all that cloister, yea of all the city for her excellent voice, and skill in music, and in carriage, and education yielded to none abroad nor within; she was witty, well spoken and above all a Calliope, or Muse for ingenious and sudden verses; which the Bishop said so much moved him to delight in her company and conversation. Her father thought nothing too good, nor too much for her; and therefore having no other children, he daily conferred upon her riches, as might best beseem a nun, as rich and costly cabinets faced with gold and silver, pictures and idols for her chamber with crowns and jewels to adorn them; which with other presents from the Bishop (who dying in my time left not wherewith to pay his debts, for that as the report went, he had spent himself and given all unto this nun) made this Doña Juana de Maldonado so rich and stately, that at her own charges she built for herself a new quarter within the cloister with rooms and galleries, and a private garden-walk, and kept at work and to wait on her half a dozen blackamoor maids; but above all she placed her delight in a private chapel or closet to pray in, being hung with rich hangings, and round about it costly láminas (as they call them) or pictures painted upon brass set in black ebony frames with corners of gold, some of silver, brought to her from Rome; her altar was accordingly decked with jewels, candlesticks, crowns, lamps, and covered with a canopy embroidered with gold; in her closet she had her small organ, and many sorts of musical instruments, whereupon she played sometimes by herself, sometimes with her best friends of the nuns; and here especially she entertained with music her beloved the Bishop. Her chapel or place of devotion was credibly reported about the city to be worth at least six thousand crowns, which was enough for a nun that had vowed chastity, poverty, and obedience. But all this after her decease she was to leave to the cloister; and doubtless with this state and riches she would win more and more the hearts of the common sort of nuns, till she had made a strong party, which by this may have made her abbess. Thus is ambition and desire of command and power crept into the walls of nunneries, like the abominations in the wall of Ezekiel, and hath possessed the hearts of nuns, which should be humble, poor, and mortified virgins.

But besides this one nun, there are many more, and also friars, who are very rich, for if the city be rich (as is this) and great trading in it, they will be sure to have a share. Great plenty and wealth hath made the inhabitants as proud and vicious as are those of Mexico. Here is not only idolatry, but fornication and uncleanness as public as in any place of the Indies. The mulattoes, blackamoors, mestizoes, Indians, and all common sort of people are much made on by the greater and richer sort, and go as gallantly apparelled as do those of Mexico, fearing neither a volcano or mountain of water on the one side, which they confess hath once poured out a flood and river executing God’s wrath against sin there committed; neither a volcano of fire, or mouth of hell on the other side, roaring within and threatening to rain upon them Sodom’s ruin and destruction; neither the weakness of their habitation, lying wide open on every side, without walls, or works, or bulwarks, to defend them, or without guns, drakes, bullets, or any ammunition to scare away an approaching enemy, who may safely come and without resistance upon them who live as professed enemies of Jesus Christ. This is the city of St James or Santiago de Guatemala, the head of a vast and ample dominion, which extendeth itself nine hundred miles to Nicoya and Costa Rica southward; three hundred miles to Chiapa and Zoques northward; a hundred and fourscore miles to the further parts of Vera Paz, and the Golfo Dulce eastward; and to the South Sea twenty or thirty, in some places forty miles westward.

From Tehuantepec (which is no harbour for any great ships) which standeth from Guatemala at least four hundred miles, there is no landing place for ships nearer to this city than is the village de la Trinidad, or of the Trinity. The chief commodities which from along that coast are brought to Guatemala, are from the provinces of Soconusco and Suchitepequez, which are extreme hot, and subject to thunder and lightning, where groweth scarce any remarkable commodity, save only cacao, achiote, mechasuchil, vainillas and other drugs for chocolate, except it be some indigo and cochineal about St Antonio, which is the chief and head town of all the Suchitepeques. But all the coast near joining to Guatemala, especially about a town called Izquinta, or Izquintepeque, twelve leagues from Guatemala, is absolutely the richest part of the dominion of this city; for there is made the greatest part of the indigo which is sent from Honduras to Spain, besides the mighty farms of cattle, which are all along that marsh. Though the living there be profitable and the soil rich, yet it is uncomfortable by reason of the great heat, thunderings and lightnings, especially from May to Michaelmas. If Guatemala be strong (though not in weapons or ammunition) in people, it is strong from hence from a desperate sort of blackamoors, who are slaves in those estancias and farms of indigo. Though they have no weapons but a machete, which is a short tuck, or lances to run at the wild cattle, yet with these they are so desperate that the city of Guatemala hath often been afraid of them, and the masters of their own slaves and servants. Some of them fear not to encounter a bull though wild and mad, and to grapple in the rivers (which are many there) with crocodiles, or lagartos, as there they call them, till they have overmastered them, and brought them out to land from the water.

This hot but rich country runs on by the seaside unto the Village of the Trinity, which (though somewhat dangerous) yet is a haven for ships from Panama, Peru, and Mexico. It serves to enrich Guatemala, but not to strengthen it, for it hath neither fort, nor bulwark, nor castle, nor any ammunition to defend itself. Between this village and the other haven called Realejo, there is a great creek from the sea; where small vessels do use to come in for fresh water and victuals to St Miguel, a town of Spaniards and Indians, from whence those that travel to Realejo pass over in less than a day to a town of Indians called La Vieja, two miles from Realejo, whither the journey by land from St Miguel is of at least three days. But neither this creek or arm of the sea is fortified (which might be done with one or two pieces of ordnance at most placed at the mouth of the sea’s entrance) neither is the Realejo strong with any ammunition, no nor with people, for it consists not of above two hundred families, and most of them are Indians and mestizoes, a people of no courage, and very unfit to defend such an open passage to Guatemala and Nicaragua, which here begins and continues in small and petty Indian towns unto Leon and Granada.

On the north side of Guatemala I shall not need to add to what hath been said of Suchitepequez and Soconusco, and my journey that way from Mexico and Chiapa. The chief side of Guatemala is that on the east, which points out the way to the gulf, or Golfo Dulce, or as others call it St Thomas de Castilla. This way is more beaten by mules and travellers than that on the north side, for that Mexico standeth three hundred leagues from this city, and the gulf but threescore, and no such passages as are in some places in the road to Mexico. Besides the great trading, commerce, and traffic which this city enjoyeth by that gulf from Spain hath made that road exceed all the rest. In July or at furthest in the beginning of August come into that gulf three ships, or two, and frigates, and unlade what they have brought from Spain in bodegas or great lodges, built up on purpose to keep dry and from the weather the commodities. They presently make haste to lade again from Guatemala those merchants’ commodities of return, which peradventure have lain waiting for them in the bodegas two or three months before the ship's arrival. So that these three months of July, August, and September, there is sure to be found a great treasure. And O the simplicity or security of the Spaniards, who appoint no other watch over these their riches, save only one or two Indians and as many mulattoes, who commonly are such as have for their misdemeanours been condemned to live in that old and ruinated castle of St Thomas de Castilla. True it is, above it there is a little and ragged town of Indians, called St Pedro, consisting of some thirty families, who by reason of the exceeding heat, and unhealthiness of the air, are always sickly and scarce able to stand upon their legs. But the weakness of this gulf within might well be remedied and supplied at the mouth of the sea, or entrance into it, by one or two at the most good pieces of ordnance placed there. For the entrance into this gulf is but as one should come in at the door of some great palace, where although the door and entrance be narrow, the house within is wide and capacious. Such is this gulf, whose entrance is straitened with two rocks or mountains on each side (which would well become two great pieces, and so scorn a whole fleet, and secure a kingdom of Guatemala nay most of all America) but here being no watch nor defence, the ships come freely and safely in (as have done some both English and Holland ships) and being entered find a road and harbour so wide and capacious as may well secure a thousand ships there riding at anchor, without any thought of fear from St Pedro, or Santo Thomas de Castilla. I have often heard the Spaniards jeer and laugh at the English and Hollanders, for that they having come into this gulf, have gone away without attempting anything further upon the land. Nay while I lived there, the Hollanders set upon Trujillo, the head port of Comayagua and Honduras, and took it (though there were some resistance), the people for the most part flying to the woods, trusting more to their feet than to their hands and weapons (such cowards is all that country full of) and whilst they might have fortified themselves there and gone into the country, or fortifying that have come on to the gulf (all Guatemala fearing it much and not being able to resist them) they left Trujillo contenting themselves with a small pillage, and gave occasion to the Spaniards to rejoice and to make processions of thanksgiving for their safe deliverance out of their enemies’ hands.

The way from this gulf to Guatemala is not so bad as some report and conceive, especially after Michaelmas until May, when the winter and rain is past and gone, and the winds begin to dry up the ways. For in the worst of the year mules laden with four hundredweight at least go easily through the deepest and most dangerous passages of the mountains that lie about this gulf. And though the ways are at that time of the year bad, yet they are so beaten with the mules, and so wide and open, that one bad step and passage may be avoided for a better; and the worst of this way continues but fifteen leagues, there being ranchos, or lodges in the way, cattle and mules also among the woods and mountains, for relief and comfort to a weary traveller. What the Spaniards most fear until they come out of these mountains are some two or three hundred blackamoors, cimarrones, who for too much hard usage have fled away from Guatemala and other parts from their masters unto these woods, and there live and bring up their children and increase daily, so that all the power of Guatemala, nay all the country about (having often attempted it), is not able to bring them under subjection. These often come out to the roadway, and set upon the recuas of mules, and take of wine, iron, clothing and weapons from them as much as they need, without doing any harm unto the people, or slaves that go with the mules; but rather these rejoice with them, being of one colour, and subject to slavery and misery which the others have shaken off; by whose example and encouragement many of these also shake off their misery, and join with them to enjoy liberty, though it be but in the woods and mountains. Their weapons are bows and arrows which they use and carry about them, only to defend themselves if the Spaniards set upon them; else they use them not against the Spaniards, who travel quietly and give them part of what provision they carry. These have often said that the chief cause of their flying to those mountains is to be in a readiness to join with the English or Hollanders, if ever they land in that gulf; for they know, from them they may enjoy that liberty which the Spaniards will never grant unto them.

After the first fifteen leagues the way is better, and there are little towns and villages of Indians, who relieve with provision both man and beast. Fifteen leagues further is a great town of Indians, called Acacabastlán, standing upon a river, which for fish is held the best of all that country. Though here are many sorts, yet above all there is one which they call bobo, a thick round fish as long or longer than a man’s arm, with only a middle bone, as white as milk, as fat as butter, and good to boil, fry, stew or bake. There is also from hence most of the way to Guatemala in brooks and shallow rivers, one of the best sort of fishes in the world, which the Spaniards judge to be a kind of trout, it is called there tepemechín, the fat whereof resembles veal more than fish.

This town of Acacabastlán is governed by a Spaniard who is called corregidor; his power extendeth no farther than to the gulf, and to those towns in the way. This governor hath often attempted to bring in those cimarrones from the mountains, but could never prevail against them. All the strength of this place may be some twenty muskets (for so many Spanish houses there may be in the town) and some few Indians that use bows and arrows, for the defence of the town against the blackamoor cimarrones.

About Acacabastlán there are many estancias of cattle and mules, much cacao, achiote, and drugs for chocolate. There is also apothecary drugs, as zarzaparrilla, and canafístula, and in the town as much variety of fruits and gardens as in any one Indian town in the country; but above all Acacabastlán is far known, and much esteemed of in the city of Guatemala, for excellent muskmelons, some small, some bigger than a man’s head, wherewith the Indians load their mules and carry them to sell all over the country. From hence to Guatemala there are but thirty short leagues, and though some hills there be, ascents and descent, yet nothing troublesome to man or beast. Among these mountains there have been discovered some mines of metal, which the Spaniards have begun to dig, and finding that they have been some of copper, and some of iron, they have let them alone, judging them more chargeable than profitable. But greater profit have the Spaniards lost, than of iron and copper, for using the poor Indians too hardly, and that in this way, from Acacabastlán to Guatemala, especially about a place called El Agua Caliente, The Hot Water, where is a river, out of which in some places formerly the Indians found such store of gold that they were charged by the Spaniards with a yearly tribute of gold. But the Spaniards being like Valdivia in Chile, too greedy after it, murdering the Indians for not discovering unto them where about this treasure lay, have lost both treasure and Indians also. Yet unto this day search is made about the mountains, the river, and the sands for the hidden treasure, which peradventure by God’s order and appointment doth and shall lie hid, and kept for a people better knowing and honouring their God. At this place called El Agua Caliente, or The Hot Water, liveth a blackamoor in an estancia of his own, who is held to be very rich, and gives good entertainment to the travellers that pass that way; he is rich in cattle, sheep, and goats, and from his farm stores Guatemala and the people thereabout with the best cheese of all that country. But his riches are thought not so much to increase from his farm and cheeses, but from this hidden treasure, which credibly is reported to be known unto him. He hath been questioned about it in the Chancery of Guatemala, but hath denied often any such treasure to be known unto him. The jealousy and suspicion of him is, for that formerly having been a slave, he bought his freedom with great sums of money, and since he hath been free, hath bought that farm and much land lying to it, and hath exceedingly increased his stock; to which he answereth, that when he was young and a slave, he had a good master, who let him get for himself what he could, and that he playing the good husband, gathered as much as would buy his liberty, and at first a little house to live in, to the which God hath since given a blessing with a greater increase of stock.

From this hot water three or four leagues, there is another river called Rio de las Vacas, or the River of Cows, where are a company of poor and country people most of them mestizoes, and mulattoes, who live in thatched houses, with some small stock of cattle, spending their time also in searching for sands of gold, hoping that one day by their diligent search they and their children, and all their country, shall be enriched, and that Rio de las Vacas shall parallel Pactolus, and stir up the wits of poets to speak of it as much as ever they have spoke of that. From this river is presently discovered the pleasantest valley in all that country (where myself did live at least five years) called the Valley of Mixco and Pinola, lying six leagues from Guatemala, being fifteen miles in length, and ten or twelve in breadth. Out of the enclosures this valley is stored with sheep; the ground enclosed is divided into many farms, where groweth better wheat than any in the country of Mexico. From this valley the city is well provided of wheat, and biscuit is made for the ships that come every year unto the gulf. It is called the Valley of Mixco and Pinola from two towns of Indians, so called, standing opposite the one to the other on each side of the valley, Pinola, on the left side from Rio de las Vacas, and Mixco on the right. Here do live many rich farmers, but yet country and clownish people, who know more of breaking clods of earth than of managing arms offensive or defensive.

But among them I must not forget one friend of mine, called Juan Palomeque, whom I should have more esteemed of than I did if I could have prevailed with him to have made him live more like a man than a beast, more like a free man than a bond slave to his gold and silver. This man had in my time three hundred lusty mules trained up in the way of the gulf, which he divided into six recuas, or companies; and for them he kept above a hundred blackamoor slaves, men, women, and children, who lived near Mixco in several thatched cottages. The house he lived in himself was but a poor thatched house, wherein he took more delight to live than in other houses which he had in Guatemala, for there he lived like a wild cimarrón among his slaves and blackamoors, whereas in the city he should have lived civilly; there he lived with milk, curds, and black, hard and mouldy biscuit, and with a dry tasajo, which is dry salted beef cut out in thin slices, and dried in the sun and wind, till there be little substance left in it, such as his slaves were wont to carry to the gulf for their provision by the way, whereas if he had lived in the city he must have eat for his credit what others of worth did eat. But the miser knew well which was the best way to save, and so chose a field for a city, a cottage for a house, company of cimarrones and blackamoors for citizens, and yet he was thought to be worth six hundred thousand ducats. He was the undoer of all others who dealt with mules for bringing and carrying commodities to the gulf for the merchants; for he having lusty mules, lusty slaves, would set the price or rate for the hundredweight so, as he might get, but others at that rate hiring Indians and servants to go with their mules, might lose. He was so cruel to his blackamoors that if any were untoward, he would torment them almost to death; amongst whom he had one slave called Macaco (for whom I have often interceded, but to little purpose) whom he would often hang up by the arms, and whip him till the blood ran about his back, and then his flesh being torn, mangled, and all in a gore blood, he would for last cure pour boiling grease upon it; he had marked him for a slave with burning irons upon his face, his hands, his arms, his back, his belly, his thighs, his legs, that the poor slave was weary of life, and I think would two or three times have hanged himself, if I had not counselled him to the contrary. He was so sensual and carnal that he would use his own slaves’ wives at his pleasure; nay when he met in the city any of that kind handsome and to his liking, if she would not yield to his desire, he would go to her master or mistress, and buy her, offering far more than she was worth, boasting that he would pull down her proud and haughty looks, with one years’ slavery under him. He killed in my time two Indians in the way to the gulf, and with his money came off, as if he had killed but a dog. He would never marry, because his slaves supplied the bed of a wife, and none of his neighbours durst say him nay; whereby he hasted to fill that valley with bastards of all sorts and colours, by whom, when that rich miser dieth, all his wealth and treasure is like to be consumed.

Besides the two towns which denominate this valley, there standeth at the east end of it close by the Rio de las Vacas an hermitage, called Nuestra Señora del Carmen, or Our Lady of Carmel, which is the parish church to all those several farms of Spaniards living in the valley; though true it is, most constantly they do resort unto the Indian towns to Mass, and in Mixco especially, the Spaniards have a rich sodality of Our Lady of the Rosary, and the blackamoors another. In all the valley there may be between forty and fifty Spanish farms or houses belonging to the hermitage, and in all these houses some three hundred slaves, men and women, blackamoors and mulattoes. Mixco is a town of three hundred families, but in it nothing considerable but the riches belonging unto the two aforenamed sodalities, and some rich Indians, who have learned of the Spaniards to break clods of earth, and to sow wheat, and to traffic with mules unto the gulf. Besides what fowls and great store of turkeys which in this town are bred, there is a constant slaughter house, where meat is sold to the Indians within, and to the farms without, and provision is made for all the recuas and slaves that go to the gulf with their masters’ mules. Besides the six recuas before named of Juan Palomeque, there are in this valley four brothers, named Don Gaspar, Don Diego, Don Thomas, Don Juan de Colindres, who have each of them a recua of threescore mules (though few slaves, and only hired Indians to go with them) to traffic to the gulf, and over all the country as far as Mexico sometimes. Yet besides these there are some six more recuas belonging to other farms, which with those of the town of Mixco may make up full twenty recuas; and those twenty recuas contain above a thousand mules, which only from this valley are employed to all parts of the country by the rich merchants of Guatemala.

But to return again to the town of Mixco, the constant passage through it of these recuas, of rich merchants, of all passengers that go and come from Spain, hath made it very rich, whereas in the town itself there is no other commodity, except it be a kind of earth, whereof are made rare and excellent pots for water, pans, pipkins, platters, dishes, chafing-dishes, warmingpans, wherein those Indians show much wit, and paint them with red, white, and several mingled colours, and sell them to Guatemala, and the towns about, which some Creole women will eat by full mouthfuls, endangering their health and lives, so that by this earthly ware they may look white and pale. The town of Pinola in bigness is much like unto Mixco, but a far pleasanter town, more healthy and better seated, standing upon a plain, whereas Mixco stands on the side of a hill, which carrieth the travellers quite out of the sight of the valley. In Pinola there is also a slaughter house, where beef is daily sold, there is plenty of fowls, fruits, maize, wheat (though not altogether so bright as that of Mixco), honey, and the best water thereabouts; it is called in the Indian tongue Panac (some say), from a fruit of that name which is very abundant there. On the north and south side of this valley are hills, which are most sown with wheat, which proveth better there than in the low valley. At the west end of it stand two greater towns than Mixco and Pinola, named Petapa and Amatitlán, to the which there are in the midst of the valley some descents and ascents, which they call barrancas or bottoms, where are pleasant streams and fountains, and good feeding for sheep, and cattle.

Petapa is a town of at least five hundred inhabitants very rich, who suffer also some Spaniards to dwell amongst them, from whom also those Indians have learned to live and thrive in the world. This town is the passage from Comayagua, St Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, and hath got great wealth by the constant goers and comers. It is esteemed one of the pleasantest towns belonging unto Guatemala, for a great lake of fresh water near unto it, which is full of fish, especially crabs, and a fish called mojarra, which is much like unto a mullet (though not altogether so big) and eateth like it. In this town there is a certain number of Indians appointed, who are to fish for the city, and on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, are bound to carry such a quantity to Guatemala, of crabs and mojarras, as the corregidor and regidores, mayor and aldermen (who are but eight) shall command weekly to be brought.

This town Petapa is so called from two Indian words, Petap, which signifieth a mat, and ha, which signifieth water, and a mat being the chief part of an Indian’s bed, it is as much as to say a bed of water, from the smoothness, plainness, and calmness of the water of the lake. There liveth in it a principal family of Indians, who are said to descend from the ancient kings of those parts, and now by the Spaniards are graced with the noble name of Guzmán; out of this family is chosen one to be Governor of the town with subordination unto the city and Chancery of Guatemala. Don Bernabé de Guzmán was Governor in my time, and had been many years before, and governed very wisely and discreetly, till with old age he came to lose his sight; and in his place entered his son Don Pedro de Guzmán, of whom the rest of the Indians stood in great awe, as formerly they had to his father. Had not these Indians been given to drunkenness (as most Indians are) they might have governed a town of Spaniards. This Governor hath many privileges granted unto him (though none to wear a sword, or rapier, as may the Governor of Chiapa of the Indians) and appoints by turn some of the town to wait and attend on him at dinner and supper, others to look to his horses, others to fish for him, others to bring him wood for his house spending, others to bring him meat for his horses; and yet after all this his attendance, he attends and waits on the friar that lives in the town, and doth nothing concerning the governing of the town and executing of justice but what the friar alloweth and adviseth to be done. There is also great service appointed for this friar, of fishermen, and other attendants in his house, who liveth as stately as any bishop. Most trades belonging to a well settled commonwealth are here exercised by these Indians. As for herbage, and garden-fruits, and requisites, it hath whatsoever may be found, or desired in the city of Guatemala.

The church treasure is very great, there being many sodalities of Our Lady and other their saints, which are enriched with crowns, and chains, and bracelets, besides the lamps, censers, and silver candlesticks belonging unto the altars. Upon Michaelmas Day is the chief fair and feast of the town, which is dedicated unto St Michael, whither many merchants resort from Guatemala to buy and sell; in the afternoon, and the next day following, bull-baiting is the common sport for that feast with some Spaniards and blackamoors on horseback, and other Indians on foot, who commonly being drunk, some venture, some lose their lives in the sport. Besides this general concourse of people every year at that time, there is every day at five o’clock in the afternoon a tianguez or market, upheld by the concourse of the Indians of the town among themselves. Besides the lake, there runneth by this town a river, which in places is easily waded over, and waters the fruits, gardens, and other plantations, and drives a mill which serves most of the valley to grind their wheat.

Within a mile and a half of this town there is a rich ingenio or farm of sugar belonging to one Sebastián de Zavaleta, a Biscayan born, who came at first very poor into that country, and served one of his countrymen; but with his good industry and pains he began to get a mule or two to traffic with about the country, till at last he increased his stock to a whole recua of mules, and from thence grew so rich that he bought much land about Petapa, which he found to be very fit for sugar, and from thence was encouraged to build a princely house, whither the best of Guatemala do resort for their recreation. This man maketh a great deal of sugar for the country, and sends every year much to Spain; he keepeth at least threescore slaves of his own for the work of his farm, is very generous in housekeeping, and is thought to be worth above five hundred thousand ducats. Within half a mile from him there is another farm of sugar, which is called but a trapiche belonging unto the Augustine friars of Guatemala, which keeps some twenty slaves, and is called a trapiche for that it grinds not the sugar cane with that device of the ingenio, but grinds a less quantity, and so makes not so much sugar as doth an ingenio. From hence three miles is the town of Amatitlán, near unto which standeth a greater ingenio of sugar than is that of Zavaleta, and is called the ingenio of one Anís, because he first founded it, but now it belongeth unto one Pedro Crespo the postmaster of Guatemala; this ingenio seemeth to be a little town by itself for the many cottages and thatched houses of blackamoor slaves which belong unto it, who may be above a hundred, men, women, and children. The chief dwelling house is strong and capacious, and able to entertain a hundred lodgers. These three farms of sugar standing so near unto Guatemala enrich the city much, and occasion great trading from it to Spain.

The town of Amatitlán, though in it there live not so many Spaniards as in Petapa, yet there are in it more Indian families than in Petapa. The streets are more orderly made and framed like a chequer board, they are wide, broad, plain, and all upon dust and sand. This town also enjoyeth the commodity of the lake, and furnisheth with fish the city of Guatemala, upon those days before named of Petapa. And though it standeth out of the road-way, yet it is almost as rich as Petapa. For the Indians of it get much by the concourse of common people, and the gentry of Guatemala, who resort thither to certain baths of hot waters, which are judged and approved very wholesome for the body. This town also getteth much by the salt which here is made, or rather gathered by the lake side, which every morning appeareth like a hoary frost upon the ground, and is taken up and purified by the Indians, and proves very white and good. Besides what they get by the salt, they get also by the recuas of mules in the valley, and about the country, which are brought to feed upon that salt earth a day, or half a day, until they be ready to burst (the owner paying sixpence a day for every mule) and it hath been found by experience that this makes them thrive and grow lusty and purgeth them better than any drench, or blood-letting. They have further great trading in cotton-wool, more abundance of fruits than Petapa, a fairer market-place with two extraordinary great elm-trees, under which the Indians daily meet at evening to buy and sell. The church of this town is as fair and beautiful as any about Guatemala, the riches and state whereof hath caused the Dominican friars since the year 1635 to make that place the head and priory over the other towns of the valley, and to build there a goodly and sumptuous cloister, in which in my time there was (for I told then most of it, and doubtless since it hath much increased) eight thousand ducats laid up in a chest, with three locks, for the common expenses of the cloister.

Thus, my Reader, I have led thee through the Valley of Mixco and Pinola, Petapa and Amatitlán, which in riches and wealth, what with the great trading in it, what with the sheep and cattle, what with the abundance of mules, what with three farms of sugar, what with the great farms of corn and wheat, what with the churches’ treasures yields to no other place belonging unto the dominions of Guatemala. I may not forget yet a double wheat harvest (as I may well term it) in this valley. The first being of a little kind of wheat, which they call trigo tremesino (a word compounded in Spanish from these two words tres meses, or from the Latin tres menses) which after three months’ sowing is ripe and ready to cut down, and being sowed about the end of August, is commonly harvested in about the end of November, and although in the smallness of it, it seems to have but a little flour, yet it yields as much as their other sorts of wheat, and makes as white bread, though it keep not so well as that which is made of other wheat, but soon groweth stale and hard. The other harvest (which is of two sorts of wheat, one called rubio, or red wheat, the other called blanquillo, or white like Candia wheat) followeth soon after this first of tremesino, for presently after Christmas everyone begins to bring their sickles into the field, where they do not only reap down their wheat, but instead of threshing it in barns, they cause it to be trod by mares enclosed within floors made on purpose in the fields; and when the wheat is trod out of the ears by the mares trampling, who are whipped round about the floors that they may not stand still, but tread it constantly and thoroughly; then the mares being let out of the floors, the wheat is winnowed from the chaff, and put up clean into sacks, and from the field carried to the barns; but the chaff and most of the straw is left to rot in the fields, which they esteem as good as dunging; and further set all the fields on fire, burning the stubble that is left a little before the time of the first showers of rain, which with the ashes left after the burning fatteth the ground, and by them is held the best way to husband or dung their ground. Others that will sow a new and woody piece of land, cause the trees, though timber trees, to be cut down, and sell not a stick of that wood (which is there so plentiful that they judge it would not quit their cost to carry it to Guatemala, though in England it would yield a thousand pounds) but they let it lie and dry, and before the winter rain begins they set on fire all the field, and burn that rich timber, with the ashes whereof that ground becomes so fat and fertile that where upon an acre we sow here three bushels of wheat, or upwards, they sow such ground so thin that they scarce dare venture a full bushel upon an acre, lest with too much spreading upon the ground it grow too thick, be lodged, and they lose their crop. The like they do unto the pasture of the valley; about the end of March, it is short and withered and dry, and they also set it on fire, which being burnt causeth a dismal sight, and prospect of a black valley; but after the first two or three showers it puts on again its green and pleasant garment, inviting the cattle, sheep, lambs, goats, and kids (which for a while were driven away to other pasturing) to return and sport again, to feed and rest in its new flourishing bosom.

But now it is time I return again back to the other end of this valley, to the Rio de las Vacas (from whence I have viewed the compass of it, and made my long digression from East to West, to the farthest town of Amatitlán) to shew thee, my Reader, the little part of thy way remaining unto Guatemala. True it is, from the hermitage of Our Lady there is a straight way through the middle of the valley leading almost to Amatitlán, and then turning up a hill out of the valley on the right hand, but that hath many ascents and descents, bottoms, falls and risings, and therefore is not the constant road, which from the hermitage pointed on the right hand, observing the town of Mixco, standing but five miles from Guatemala. From Mixco the way lieth up a hill, and leadeth to a town somewhat bigger than Mixco, of Indians called San Lucas, or St Luke, a cold town, but exceeding rich; the temper and coldness of it hath made it the storehouse, or granary, for all the city; for whereas below in the valley the wheat will not keep long without musting, and breeding a worm called gorgojo, such is the temper of this town of St Luke, that in it the wheat will keep two or three years ready threshed, with a little turning now and then; and as it lieth will give and yield (as experience taught me there) so that he that hath laid up in that town two hundred bushels of wheat, at the year’s end shall find near upon two hundred and twenty bushels. This town therefore receives from the valley most of the harvest, and is full of what we call barns, but there are called trojes, without floors, but raised up with stacks and boards a foot or two from the ground, and covered with mats, whereon is laid the wheat, and by some rich monopolists from the city is kept and hoarded two and three years, until they find their best opportunity to bring it out to sale, at the rate of their own will and pleasure. From hence to Guatemala there is but three little leagues, and one only barranca, or bottom, and on every side of the way little petty towns, which they call mitas, consisting of some twenty cottages. In the middle of the way is the top of a hill, which discovereth all the city, and standeth as overmastering of it, as if with a piece or two of ordnance it would keep all Guatemala in awe. But besides this hill, which is the wide and open road, there stand yet forwarder on the right and left hand other mountains which draw nearer to the city, and what this top peradventure with too much distance, is not able to do or reach, the others certainly would reach with cannon shot, and command that far commanding city. Down this hill the way lies broad and wide, and as open as is the way down Barnet or Highgate Hill; and at the bottom it is more straitened between the mountains, for the space of a bow-shot, which passage also is craggy by reason of stones and some small pieces of rocks which lie in a brook of water that descends from the mountains, and runs towards the city. But at a little hermitage called St John, the way opens again itself, and sheweth Guatemala, welcoming the weary travellers with a pleasant prospect, and easing theirs, or their mules’ or horses’ feet, what with green walks, what with a sandy and gravelly road unto the city, which never shut gate against any goer or comer, nor forbad their entrance with any fenced walls, or watchmen’s jealous questions, but freely and gladly entertains them either by the back side of the Dominican’s cloister, or by the church and nunnery called the Conception. And thus, my Reader, and countryman, I have brought and guided thee from the gulf unto Guatemala, shewing what that way is most remarkable.

I shall not now shew thee any more of this city’s dominions toward Nicaragua and the South (having already shewed thee the way as far as Realejo) leaving that until I come to tell thee of my journey homewards, which I made that way. There remains yet the country of the Vera Paz and the way unto it to discover, and so to close up this chapter. The Vera Paz is so called, for that the Indians of that country hearing how the Spaniards had conquered Guatemala, and did conquer the country round about, wheresoever they came, yielded themselves peaceably and without any resistance unto the government of Spain. This country formerly had a bishop to itself distinct from Guatemala, but now is made one bishopric with that. It is governed by an Alcalde Mayor, or High Justice sent from Spain, with subordination unto the Court of Guatemala. The head or shire town of it is called Cobán, where is a cloister of Dominican friars, and the common place of residence of the Alcalde Mayor. All this country as yet is not subdued by the Spaniards, who have now and then some strong encounters with the barbarous and heathen people, which lie between this country and Yucatán; and fain would the Spaniards conquer them, that they might make way through them unto a town called Campín belonging to Yucatán, and settle commerce and traffic by land with that country, which is thought would be a great furtherance to the country and city of Guatemala, and a safer way to convey their goods to Havana than by the gulf, for oftentimes the ships that go from the gulf to Havana are met with by the Hollanders and surprised. But as yet the Spaniards have not been able to bring to pass this their design, by reason they have found strong resistance from the heathenish people, and a hot service to attempt the conquering of them. Yet there was a friar a great acquaintance of mine, called Friar Francisco Morán, who ventured his life among those barbarians, and with two or three Indians went on foot through that country, until he came unto Campín, where he found a few Spaniards, who wondered at his courage and boldness in coming that way. This friar came back again to Cobán and Vera Paz, relating how the barbarians hearing him speak their language, and finding him kind, loving, and courteous to them, used him also kindly, fearing (as he said) that if they should kill him, the Spaniards would never let them be at rest and quiet until they had utterly destroyed them. He related when he came back, that the country which the barbarians inhabit is better than any part of the Vera Paz, which is subject to the Spaniards, and spoke much of a valley where is a great lake, and about it a town of Indians, which he judged to be of at least twelve thousand inhabitants, the cottages lying in a distance one from another. This friar hath writ of this country, and hath gone to Spain to the Court to motion the conquering of it, for the profit and commodity that may ensue both to Guatemala and Yucatán, if a way were opened thither. But though as yet on that side the Spaniards and the country of the Vera Paz be straitened by that heathenish people, yet on the other side it hath free passage unto the gulf, and trade there when the ships do come, carrying fowls and what other provision the country will afford for the ships, and bringing from thence wines and other Spanish wares unto Cobán. This country is very hilly and craggy, and though there be some big towns in it, they are not above three or four that are considerable.

The chief commodities are achiote (which is the best of all the country belonging to Guatemala) and cacao, cotton-wool, honey, canafístula, and zarzaparrilla, great store of maize, but no wheat, much wax, plenty of fowls and birds of all coloured feathers, wherewith the Indians make some curious works, but not like unto those of Michoacán; here are also abundance of parrots, apes and monkeys which breed in the mountains. The way from Guatemala to this country is that which hitherto hath been spoken of from the gulf, as far as the town of St Luke; and from thence the way keeps on the hills and mountains which lie on the side of the Valley of Mixco. These hills are called Sacatepéquez, (compounded of Sacate and Tepec, the latter signifying a hill, and the former, herb or grass, and thus joined they signify mountains of grass) and among them are these chief towns, first Santiago or St James, a town of five hundred families, secondly, San Pedro or St Peter, consisting of six hundred families, thirdly St Juan, or St John, consisting also of at least six hundred families, and fourthly Sto Domingo Senaco, or St Dominic of Senaco, being of three hundred families. These four towns are very rich, and the two last very cold, the two first are warmer; there are about them many farms of corn and good wheat, besides the Indian maize. These Indians are somewhat of more courage than those of other towns, and in my time were like to rise up against the Spaniards for their unmerciful tyranny over them. The churches are exceeding rich; in the town of Santiago, there was living in my time one Indian, who for only vainglory had bestowed the worth of six thousand ducats upon that church, and yet afterwards this wretch was found to be a wizard and idolater. These Indians get much money by letting out great tufts of feathers, which the Indians use in their dances upon the feasts of the dedication of their towns. For some of the great tufts may have at least threescore long feathers of divers colours; for every feather hiring they have half a real, besides what price they set to every feather if any should chance to be lost.

From the town of St John, which is the furthest, the way lies plain and pleasant unto a little village of some twenty cottages, called St Raymundo or St Raymond, from whence there is a good day's journey up and down barrancas, or bottoms unto a rancho, or lodge standing by a river side, which is the same river that passeth by the town of Acacabastlán spoken of before. From this is an ascent or a very craggy and rocky mountain, called the Mountain of Rabinal, where are steps cut out in the very rocks for the mules' feet, and slipping on one or the other side, they fall surely down the rocks, breaking their necks, and mangling all their limbs and joints; but this danger continueth not long nor extendeth above a league and a half, and in the top and worst of this danger there is the comfort of a goodly valley, called El Valle de San Nicolás, St Nicholas his Valley, from an estancia called St Nicholas belonging to the Dominicans’ cloister of Cobán. This valley though it must not compare with that of Mixco and Pinola, yet next after it, it may well take place for only three things considerable in it. The first is an ingenio of sugar, called San Geronymo, or St Hierome, belonging unto the Dominicans’ cloister of Guatemala, which indeed goeth beyond that spoken of of Amatitlán, both for abundance of sugar made there and sent by mules to Guatemala over that rocky mountain, and for multitude of slaves living in it under the command of two friars, and for the excellent horses bred there, which are incomparably the best of all the country of Guatemala for mettle, and gallantry, and therefore (though mules are commonly used for burdens) are much desired and looked after by the gallants and gentry of the city, who make it a great part of their honour to prance about the streets. The second thing in this valley is the estancia or farm of St Nicholas which is as famous for breeding of mules as is St Hierome for horses. The third ornament to it is a town of Indians, called Rabinal, of at least eight hundred families, which hath all that heart can wish for pleasure and life of man. It inclineth rather to heat than cold, but the heat is moderate and much qualified with the many cool and shady walks. There is not any Indian fruit which is not there to be found, besides the fruits of Spain, as oranges, lemons, sweet and sour, citrons, pomegranates, grapes, figs, almonds, and dates; the only want of wheat is not a want to them that mind bread of wheat more than of maize, for in two days it is easily brought from the towns of Sacatepéquez. For flesh, it hath beef, mutton, kid, fowls, turkeys, quails, partridges, rabbits, pheasants, and for fish it hath a river running by the houses, which yieldeth plenty both great and small. The Indians of this town are much like unto those of Chiapa of the Indians for bravery, for feasting, for riding of horses, and shewing themselves in sports and pastimes. This town my friend Friar John Baptist, after he had been Prior of many places, and especially of Chiapa and Guatemala, chose to live in to enjoy quietness, pleasure, and content; and in this town was I feasted by him in such a sumptuous, prodigal and lavishing way, as truly might make poor mendicant friars ashamed to come so near unto princes in vanity of life and diet.

From this valley unto the Vera Paz, or Cobán, the head town of it, there is nothing considerable, save only one town more called St Cristóbal or St Christopher, which enjoyeth now a pleasant lake, and bottomless, as is reported. Formerly there being no lake at all, in a great earthquake the earth there opened, and swallowed up many houses, leaving this lake which ever since hath continued. From hence to Cobán the ways are bad and mountainous, yet such as through the worst of them those country mules with heavy burdens easily go through. And thus with my pen, Reader, have I gone through most of the bounds and limits of Guatemala, which is more furnished with gallant towns of Indians than is any part of all America; and doubtless were the Indians warlike, industrious, active for war or weapons, no part in all America might be stronger in people than Guatemala. But they being kept under and oppressed by the Spaniards, and no weapons allowed them, not so much as their natural bows and arrows, much less guns, pistols, muskets, swords, or pikes, their courage is gone, their affections alienated from the Spaniards, and so the Spaniards might very well fear that if their country should be invaded, the multitude of their Indian people would prove to them a multitude of enemies, either running away to another side; or forced to help, would be to them but as the help of so many flies.

CHAPTER XIV

Shewing the condition, quality, fashion, and behaviour of the Indians of the country of Guatemala since the Conquest, and especially of their feasts and yearly solemnities

The condition of the Indians of this country of Guatemala is as sad, and as much to be pitied as of any Indians in America, for that I may say it is with them, in some sort, as it was with Israel in Egypt. Though it is true there ought not to be any comparison made betwixt the Israelites and the Indians, those being God’s people, these not as yet; nevertheless the comparison may well hold in the oppression of the one and the other, and in the manner and cause of the oppression, that being with bitterness, rigour, and hard bondage, and lest they should multiply and increase too much. Certain it is, these Indians suffer great oppression from the Spaniards, live in great bitterness, are under hard bondage, and serve with great rigour; and all this because they are at least a thousand of them for one Spaniard. They daily multiply and increase, in children and wealth, and therefore are feared lest they should be too mighty, and either rise up of themselves, or join themselves to any enemy against their oppressors; for both which fears and jealousies they are not allowed the use of any weapons or arms, no not their bows and arrows, which their ancestors formerly used, so that as hereby the Spaniards are secured from any hurt or annoyance from them as an unarmed people, so may any other nation that shall be encouraged to invade that land be secure also from the Indians, consequently the Spaniards’ own policy for themselves against the Indians may be their greatest ruin and destruction, being a great people and yet no people; for the abundance of their Indians would be to them as no people, and they themselves (who out of their few towns and cities live but here and there, too thinly scattered upon so great and capacious a land) would be but a handful for any reasonable army; and of that handful very few would be found able or fitting men, and those able men would do little without the help of guns and ordnance; and if their own oppressed people, blackamoors and Indians (which themselves have always feared) should side against them, soon would they be swallowed up both from within and from without. And by this it may easily appear how ungrounded they are, who say it is harder to conquer America now than in Cortez his time, for that there are now both Spaniards and Indians to fight against, and then there were none but bare and naked Indians. This I say is a false ground, for then there were Indians trained up in wars one against another, who knew well to use their bows and arrows, and darts, and other weapons, and were desperate in their fights and single combats, as may appear out of the histories of them; but now they are cowardized, oppressed, unarmed, soon frighted with the noise of a musket, nay with a sour and grim look of a Spaniard, so from them there is no fear. Neither can there be from the Spaniards, who from all the vast dominions of Guatemala are not able to raise five thousand able fighting men, nor to defend so many passages as lie open in several parts of that country, which the wider and greater it is might be advantageous to an enemy, and while the Spaniard in one place might oppose his strength, in many other places might his land be overrun by a foreign nation; nay by their own slaves the blackamoors who doubtless to be set at liberty would side against them in any such occasion; and lastly, the Creoles who also are sore oppressed by them, would rejoice in such a day, and yield rather to live with freedom and liberty under a foreign people than to be longer oppressed by those of their own blood.

The miserable condition of the Indians of that country is such that though the Kings of Spain have never yielded to what some would have, that they should be slaves, yet their lives are as full of bitterness as is the life of a slave. For which I have known myself some of them that have come home from toiling and moiling with Spaniards, after many blows, some wounds, and little or no wages, who have sullenly and stubbornly lain down upon their beds, resolving to die rather than to live any longer a life so slavish, and have refused to take either meat or drink or anything else comfortable and nourishing, which their wives have offered unto them, that so by pining and starving they might consume themselves. Some I have by good persuasions encouraged to life rather than to a voluntary and wilful death; others there have been that would not be persuaded, but in that wilful way have died.

The Spaniards that live about that country (especially the farmers of the Valley of Mixco, Pinola, Petapa, Amatitlán, and those of the Sacatepéquez) allege that all their trading and farming is for the good of the commonwealth, and therefore whereas there are not Spaniards enough for so ample and large a country to do all their work, and all are not able to buy slaves and blackamoors, they stand in need of the Indians’ help to serve them for their pay and hire; whereupon it hath been considered that a partition of Indian labourers be made every Monday, or Sunday in the afternoon to the Spaniards, according to the farms they occupy, or according to their several employments, calling, and trading with mules, or any other way. So that for such and such a district there is named an officer, who is called juez repartidor, who according to a list made of every farm, house, and person, is to give so many Indians by the week. And here is a door opened to the President of Guatemala, and to the judges, to provide well for their menial servants, whom they commonly appoint for this office, which is thus performed by them. They name the town and place of their meeting upon Sunday or Monday, to the which themselves and the Spaniards of that district do resort. The Indians of the several towns are to have in a readiness so many labourers as the Court of Guatemala hath appointed to be weekly taken out of such a town, who are conduced by an Indian officer to the town of general meeting; and when they come thither with their tools, their spades, shovels, bills, or axes, with their provision of victuals for a week (which are commonly some dry cakes of maize, puddings of frijoles, or French beans, and a little chilli or biting long pepper, or a bit of cold meat for the first day or two) and with beds on their backs (which is only a coarse woollen mantle to wrap about them when they lie on the bare ground) then are they shut up in the town-house, some with blows, some with spurnings, some with boxes on the ear, if presently they go not in.

Now all being gathered together, and the house filled with them, the juez repartidor, or officer, calls by the order of the list such and such a Spaniard, and also calls out of the house so many Indians as by the Court are commanded to be given him (some are allowed three, some four, some ten, some fifteen, some twenty, according to their employments) and delivereth unto the Spaniard his Indians, and so to all the rest, till they be all served; who when they receive their Indians, take from them a tool, or their mantles, to secure them that they run not away; and for every Indian delivered unto them, they give unto the juez repartidor, or officer, half a real, which is threepence an Indian for his fees, which mounteth yearly to him to a great deal of money; for some officers make a partition or distribution of four hundred, some of two hundred, some of three hundred Indians every week, and carrieth home with him so many half hundred reals for one, or half a day’s work. If complaint be made by any Spaniard that such and such an Indian did run away from him, and served him not the week past, the Indian must be brought, and surely tied to a post by his hands in the market-place, and there be whipped upon his bare back. But if the poor Indian complain that the Spaniards cozened and cheated him of his shovel, axe, bill, mantle, or wages, no justice shall be executed against the cheating Spaniard, neither shall the Indian be righted, though it is true the order runs equally in favour of both Indian and Spaniard. Thus are the poor Indians sold for threepence apiece for a whole week’s slavery, not permitted to go home at nights unto their wives, though their work lie not above a mile from the town where they live; nay some are carried ten or twelve miles from their home, who must not return till Saturday night late, and must that week do whatsoever their master pleaseth to command them. The wages appointed them will scarce find them meat and drink, for they are not allowed a real a day, which is but sixpence, and with that they are to find themselves, but for six days’ work and diet they are to have five reals, which is half a crown. This same order is observed in the city of Guatemala, and towns of Spaniards, where to every family that wants the service of an Indian or Indians, though it be but to fetch water and wood on their backs, or to go of errands, is allowed the like service from the nearest Indian towns.

It would grieve a Christian’s heart to see how by some cruel Spaniards in that week’s service those poor wretches are wronged and abused; some visiting their wives at home, whilst their poor husbands are digging and delving; others whipping them for their slow working; others wounding them with their swords, or breaking their heads for some reasonable and well grounded answer in their own behalf; others stealing from them their tools; others cheating them of half, others of all their wages; alleging that their service cost them half a real, and yet their work not well performed. I knew some who made a common practice of this, when their wheat was sown, and they had little to do for the Indians; yet they would have home as many as were due unto their farm, and on Monday and Tuesday would make them cut and bring them on their backs as much wood as they needed all that week, and then on Wednesday at noon (knowing the great desire of the Indians to go home to their wives, for the which they would give anything) would say unto them: ‘What will you give me now, if I let you go home to do your own work?’ Whereunto the Indians would joyfully reply and answer, some that they would give a real, others two reals, which they would take and send them home, and so would have much work done, wood to serve their house a week, and money as much as would buy them meat, and cacao for chocolate two weeks together; and thus from the poor Indians do those unconscionable Spaniards practise a cheap and lazy way of living. Others will sell them away for that week unto a neighbour that hath present need of work, demanding reals apiece for every Indian, which he that buyeth them will be sure to defray out of their wages. So likewise are they in a slavish bondage and readiness for all passengers and travellers, who in any town may demand unto the next town as many Indians to go with his mules, or to carry on their backs a heavy burden as he shall need, who at the journey’s end will pick some quarrel with them, and so send them back with blows and stripes without any pay at all. A petaca, or leathern trunk, and chest of above a hundredweight, they will make those wretches to carry on their backs a whole day, nay some two or three days together, which they do by tying the chest on each side with ropes, having a broad leather in the middle, which they cross over the forepart of their head, or over their forehead, hanging thus the weight upon their heads and brows, which at their journey’s end hath made the blood stick in the foreheads of some, galling and pulling off the skin, and marking them in the fore-top of their heads, who as they are called tamemes, so are easily known in a town by their baldness, that leather girt having worn off all their hair. With these hard usages yet do those poor people make a shift to live amongst the Spaniards, but so that with anguish of heart they are still crying out to God for justice, and for liberty, whose only comfort is in their priests and friars, who many times do quiet them when they would rise up in mutiny, and for their own ends do often prevail over them with fair and cunning persuasions, to bear and suffer for God’s sake, and for the good of the commonwealth that hard task and service which is laid upon them. And though in all seasons, wet and dry, cold and hot, and in all ways plain and mountainous, green and dirty, dusty and stony, they must perform this hard service to their commanding masters, their apparel and clothing is but such as may cover the nakedness of their body, nay in some it is such torn rags as will not cover half their nakedness.

Their ordinary clothing is a pair of linen or woollen drawers broad and open at the knees, without shoes (though in their journeys some will put on leathern sandals to keep the soles of their feet) or stockings, without any doublet, a short coarse shirt, which reacheth a little below their waist, and serves more for a doublet than for a shirt, and for a cloak a woollen or linen mantle (called ayate) tied with a knot over one shoulder, hanging down on the other side almost to the ground, with a twelvepenny or two shilling hat, which after one good shower of rain like paper falls about their necks and eyes; their bed they carry sometimes about them, which is that woollen mantle wherewith they wrap themselves about at night, taking off their shirt and drawers, which they lay under their head for a pillow; some will carry with them a short, slight, and light mat to lie, but those that carry it not with them, if they cannot borrow one of a neighbour, lie as willingly in their mantle upon the bare ground as a gentleman in England upon a soft down-bed, and thus do they soundly sleep, and loudly snort after a day’s work, or after a day’s journey with a hundredweight upon their backs.

Those that are of the better sort, and richer, and who are not employed as tamemes to carry burdens, or as labourers to work for Spaniards, but keep at home following their own farms, or following their own mules about the country, or following their trades and callings in their shops, or governing the towns, as alcaldes, or alguaciles, officers of justice, may go a little better apparelled, but after the same manner. For some will have their drawers with a lace at the bottom, or wrought with some coloured silk or crewel, so likewise the mantle about them shall have either a lace, or some work of birds on it; some will wear a cut linen doublet, others shoes, but very few stockings or bands about their necks; and for their beds, the best Indian Governor or the richest, who may be worth four or five thousand ducats, will have little more than the poor tamemes; for they lie upon boards, or canes bound together, and raised from the ground, whereon they lay a broad and handsome mat, and at their heads for man and wife two little stumps of wood for bolsters, whereon they lay their shirts and mantles and other clothes for pillows, covering themselves with a broader blanket than is their mantle, and thus hardly would Don Bernabé de Guzmán the Governor of Petapa lie, and so do all the best of them. The women’s attire is cheap and soon put on; for most of them also go barefoot, the richer and better sort wear shoes, with broad ribbons for shoe-strings, and for a petticoat, they tie about their waist a woollen mantle, which in the better sort is wrought with divers colours, but not sewed at all, pleated, or gathered in, but as they tie it with a list about them; they wear no shift next their body, but cover their nakedness with a kind of surplice (which they call guaipil) which hangs loose from their shoulders down a little below their waist, with open short sleeves, which cover half their arms; this guaipil is curiously wrought, especially in the bosom, with cotton, or feathers. The richer sort of them wear bracelets and bobs about their wrists and necks; their hair is gathered up with fillets, without any coif or covering, except it be the better sort. When they go to church or abroad, they put upon their heads a veil of linen, which hangeth almost to the ground, and this is that which costs them most of all their attire, for that commonly it is of Holland or some good linen brought from Spain, or fine linen brought from China, which the better sort wear with a lace about. When they are at home at work they commonly take off their guaipil, or surplice, discovering the nakedness of their breasts and body. They lie also in their beds as do their husbands, wrapped up only with a mantle, or with a blanket.

Their houses are but poor thatched cottages, without any upper rooms, but commonly one or two only rooms below, in the one they dress their meat in the middle of it, making a compass for fire, with two or three stones, without any other chimney to convey the smoke away, which spreading itself about the room filleth the thatch and the rafters so with soot that all the room seemeth to be a chimney. The next unto it is not free from smoke and blackness, where sometimes are four or five beds according to the family. The poorer sort have but one room, where they eat, dress their meat, and sleep. Few there are that set any locks upon their doors, for they fear no robbing nor stealing, neither have they in their houses much to lose, earthen pots, and pans, and dishes, and cups to drink their chocolate being the chief commodities in their house. There is scarce any house which hath not also in the yard a stew, wherein they bathe themselves with hot water, which is their chief physic when they feel themselves distempered.

Among themselves they are in every town divided into tribes, which have one chief head, to whom all that belong unto that tribe do resort in any difficult matters, who is bound to aid, protect, defend, counsel, and appear for the rest of his tribe before the officers of justice in any wrong that is like to be done unto them. When any is to be married, the father of the son that is to take a wife out of another tribe goeth unto the head of his tribe to give him warning of his son’s marriage with such a maid. Then that head meets with the head of the maid’s tribe, and they confer about it. The business commonly is in debate a quarter of a year; all which time the parents of the youth or man are with gifts to buy the maid; they are to be at the charges of all that is spent in eating and drinking when the heads of the two tribes do meet with the rest of the kindred of each side, who sometimes sit in conference a whole day, or most part of a night. After many days and nights thus spent, and a full trial being made of the one and other side’s affection, if they chance to disagree about the marriage, then is the tribe and parents of the maid to restore back all that the other side hath spent and given. They give no portions with their daughters, but when they die their goods and lands are equally divided among their sons. If anyone want a house to live in, or will repair and thatch his house anew, notice is given to the heads of the tribes, who warn all the town to come to help in the work, and everyone is to bring a bundle of straw, and other materials, so that in one day with the help of many they finish a house, without any charges more than of chocolate, which they minister in great cups as big as will hold above a pint, not putting in any costly materials, as do the Spaniards, but only a little aniseed, and chilli, or Indian pepper; or else they half fill the cup with atole, and pour upon it as much chocolate as will fill the cup and colour it.

In their diet the poorer sort are limited many times to a dish of frijoles, or Turkey beans, either black or white (which are there in very great abundance, and are kept dry for all the year) boiled with chilli; and if they can have this, they hold themselves well satisfied; with these beans, they make also dumplings, first boiling the bean a little, and then mingling it with a mass of maize, as we do mingle currants in our cakes, and so boil again the frijoles with the dumpling of maize mass, and so eat it hot, or keep it cold; but this and all whatsoever else they eat, they either eat it with green biting chilli, or else they dip it in water and salt, wherein is bruised some of that chilli. But if their means will not reach to frijoles, their ordinary fare and diet is their tortillas (so they call thin round cakes made of the dough and mass of maize) which they eat hot from an earthen pan, whereon they are soon baked with one turning over the fire; and these they eat alone either with chilli and salt, and dipping them in water and salt with a little bruised chilli. When their maize is green and tender, they boil some of those whole stalks or clusters, whereon the maize groweth with the leaf about, and so casting a little salt about it, they eat it. I have often eat of this, and found it as dainty as our young green peas, and very nourishing, but it much increaseth the blood. Also of this green and tender maize they make a furmety, boiling the maize in some of the milk which they have first taken out of it by bruising it. The poorest Indian never wants this diet, and is well satisfied as long as his belly is thoroughly filled.

But the poorest that live in such towns where flesh meat is sold will make a hard shift but that when they come from work on Saturday night they will buy one half real, or a real worth of fresh meat to eat on the Lord’s day. Some will buy a good deal at once, and keep it long by dressing it into tasajos, which are bundles of flesh, rolled up and tied fast, which they do when, for example’s sake, they have from a leg of beef sliced off from the bone all the flesh with the knife, after the length, form, and thinness of a line, or rope. Then they take the flesh and salt it, (which being sliced and thinly cut, soon takes salt) and hang it up in their yards like a line from post to post, or from tree to tree, to the wind for a whole week, and then they hang it in the smoke another week, and after roll it up in small bundles, which become as hard as a stone, and so as they need it they wash it, boil it and eat it. This is America’s powdered beef, which they call tasajo, whereof I have often eaten, and the Spaniards eat much of it, especially those that trade about the country with mules; nay this tasajo is a great commodity, and hath made many a Spaniard rich, who carry a mule or two loaden with these tasajos in small parcels and bundles to those towns where is no flesh at all sold, and there they exchange them for other commodities among the Indians, receiving peradventure for one tasajo or bundle, (which cost them but the half part of a farthing) as much cacao as in other places they sell for a real or sixpence. The richer sort of people will fare better, for if there be fish or flesh to be had they will have it, and eat most greedily of it, and will not spare their fowls and turkeys from their own bellies. These also will now and then get a wild deer, shooting it with their bows and arrows. And when they have killed it, they let it lie in the wood in some hole or bottom covered with leaves for the space of about a week, until it stink and begin to be full of worms; then they bring it home, cut it out into joints, and parboil it with an herb which groweth there somewhat like unto our tansy, which they say sweeteneth it again, and maketh the flesh eat tender, and as white as a piece of turkey. Thus parboiled, they hang up the joints in the smoke for awhile, and then boil it again, when they eat it, which is commonly dressed with red Indian pepper; and this is the venison of America, whereof I have sometimes eaten, and found it white and short, but never durst be too bold with it, not that I found any evil taste in it, but that the apprehension of the worms and maggots which formerly had been in it troubled much my stomach.

These Indians that have little to do at home, and are not employed in the weekly service under the Spaniards in their hunting, will look seriously for hedgehogs, which are just like unto ours, though certainly ours are not meat for any Christian. They are full of pricks and bristles like ours, and are found in woods and fields, living in holes, and as they say feed upon nothing but ants [emmetts] and their eggs, and upon dry rotten sticks, herbs, and roots; of these they eat much, the flesh being as white and sweet as a rabbit, and as fat as is a January hen kept up and fatted in a coop. Of this meat I have also eaten, and confess it is a dainty dish there, though I will not say the same of a hedgehog here; for what here may be poison, there may be good and lawful meat, by some accidental difference in the creature itself, and in that which it feeds upon, or in the temper of the air and climate. This meat not only the Indians but the best of the Spaniards feed on it; and it is so much esteemed of, that because in Lent they are commonly found, the Spaniards will not be deprived of it, but do eat it also then, alleging that it is no flesh (though in the eating it be in fatness and in taste and in all like unto flesh) for that it feeds not upon anything that is very nourishing, but chiefly upon ants’ eggs, and dry sticks. It is a great point of controversy amongst their divines, some hold it lawful, others unlawful for that time; it seems the pricks and bristles of the Indian hedgehog prick their consciences with a foolish scruple.

Another kind of meat they feed much on which is called iguana; of these some are found in the waters, others upon the land. They are longer than a rabbit, and like unto a scorpion, with some green, some black scales on their backs. Those upon the land will run very fast, like lizards, and will climb up trees like squirrels, and breed in the roots of trees or in stone walls. The sight of them is enough to affright one; and yet when they are dressed and stewed in broth with a little spice, they make a dainty broth, and eat also as white as a rabbit, nay the middle bone is made just like the backbone of a rabbit. They are dangerous meat, if not thoroughly boiled, and they had almost cost me my life for eating too much of them, not being stewed enough. There are also many water and land tortoises, which the Indians find out for themselves, and also relish exceeding well unto the Spaniard’s palate.

As for drinking, the Indians generally are much given unto it; and drink if they have nothing else of their poor and simple chocolate, without sugar or many compounds, or of atole, until their bellies be ready to burst. But if they can get any drink that will make them mad drunk, they will not give it over as long as a drop is left, or a penny remains in their purse to purchase it. Among themselves they use to make such drinks as are in operation far stronger than wine; and these they confection in such great jars as come from Spain, wherein they put some little quantity of water, and fill up the jar with some molasses or juice of the sugar-cane, or some honey for to sweeten it; then for the strengthening of it, they put roots and leaves of tobacco, with other kind of roots which grow there, and they know to be strong in operation, nay in some places I have known where they have put in a live toad, and so closed up the jar for a fortnight, or month’s space, till all that they have put in be thoroughly steeped and the toad consumed, and the drink well strengthened, then they open it, and call their friends to the drinking of it (which commonly they do in the night time, lest their priest in the town should have notice of them in the day), which they never leave off until they be mad and raging drunk. This drink they call chicha, which stinketh most filthily, and certainly is the cause of many Indians’ death, especially where they use the toad’s poison with it. Once I was informed living in Mixco, of a great meeting that was appointed in an Indian’s house; and I took with me the officers of justice of the town to search that Indian’s house, where I found four jars of chicha not yet opened; I caused them to be taken out, and broken in the street before his door, and the filthy chicha to be poured out, which left such a stinking scent in my nostrils, that with the smell of it, or apprehension of its loathsomeness, I fell to vomiting, and continued sick almost a whole week after.


Now the Spaniards, knowing this inclination of the Indians unto drunkenness, do herein much abuse and wrong them; though true it is, there is a strict order, even to the forfeiting of the wine of anyone who shall presume to sell wine in a town of Indians, with a money mulct besides. Yet for all this the baser and poorer sort of Spaniards for their lucre and gain contemning authority, will go out from Guatemala to the towns of Indians about, and carry such wine to sell and inebriate the natives as may be very advantageous to themselves; for of one jar of wine they will make two at least, confectioning it with honey and water, and other strong drugs which are cheap to them, and strongly operative upon the poor and weak Indians’ heads, and this they will sell for current Spanish wine, with such pint and quart measures as never were allowed by justice order, but by themselves invented. With such wine they soon intoxicate the poor Indians, and when they have made them drunk, then they will cheat them more, making them pay double for their quart measure; and when they see they can drink no more, then they will cause them to lie down and sleep, and in the meanwhile will pick their pockets. This is a common sin among those Spaniards of Guatemala, and much practised in the city upon the Indians, when they come thither to buy or sell. Those that keep the bodegones (so are called the houses that sell wine, which are no better than a chandler’s shop, for besides wine they sell candles, fish, salt, cheese, and bacon) will commonly entice in the Indians, and make them drunk, and then pick their pockets, and turn them out of doors with blows and stripes, if they will not fairly depart. There was in Guatemala in my time one of these bodegoners, or shopkeeper of wine and small ware, named John Ramos, who by thus cheating and tippling poor Indians (as it was generally reported) was worth two hundred thousand ducats, and in my time gave with a daughter that was married, eight thousand ducats. No Indian should pass by his door but he would call him in, and play upon him as aforesaid. In my time a Spanish farmer, neighbour of mine in the Valley of Mixco, chanced to send to Guatemala his Indian servants with half a dozen mules laden with wheat to a merchant, with whom he had agreed before for the price, and ordered the money to be sent unto him by his servant (whom he had kept six years, and ever found him trusty). The wheat being delivered, and the money received (the which mounted to ten pound, sixteen shillings, every mule carrying six bushels, at twelve reals a bushel, as was then the price) the Indian with another mate of his walking along the streets to buy some small commodities, passed by John Ramos his shop, or bodegon, who enticing him and his mate in, soon tripped up their heels with a little confectioned wine for that purpose, and took away all his money from the entrusted Indian, and beat them out of his house, who thus drunk being forced to ride home, the Indian that had received the money fell from his mule and broke his neck; the other got home without his mate or money. The farmer prosecuted John Ramos in the court for his money, but Ramos being rich and abler to bribe than the farmer, got off very well, and so had done formerly in almost the like cases. These are but peccadilloes among those Spaniards, to make drunk, rob, and occasion the poor Indian’s death; whose death with them is no more regarded nor vindicated than the death of a sheep or bullock that falls into a pit.

And thus having spoken of apparel, houses, eating and drinking, it remains that I say somewhat of their civility, and religion of those who lived under the government of the Spaniards. From the Spaniards they have borrowed their civil government, and in all towns they have one, or two, alcaldes, with more or less regidores (who are as aldermen or jurats amongst us) and some alguaciles, more or less, who are as constables, to execute the orders of the alcalde (who is a mayor) with his brethren. In towns of three or four hundred families, or upwards, there are commonly two alcaldes, six regidores, two alguaciles mayores, and six under, or petty, alguaciles. And some towns are privileged with an Indian Governor, who is above the alcaldes and all the rest of the officers. These are changed every year by new election, and are chosen by the Indians themselves, who take their turns by the tribes or kindreds, whereby they are divided. Their offices begin on New Year’s Day, and after that day their election is carried to the city of Guatemala (if in that district it be made) or else to the heads of justice, or Spanish governors of the several provinces, who confirm the new election, and take account of the last year’s expenses made by the other officers, who carry with them their town-book of accounts; and therefore for this purpose every town hath a clerk, or scrivener, called escribano, who commonly continueth many years in his office, by reason of the paucity and unfitness of Indian scriveners who are able to bear such a charge. This clerk hath many fees for his writings and informations, and accounts, as have the Spaniards, though not so much money or bribes, but a small matter, according to the poverty of the Indians. The Governor is also commonly continued many years, being some chief man among the Indians, except for his misdemeanours he be complained of, or the Indians in general do all stomach him.

Thus they being settled in a civil way of government they may execute justice upon all such Indians of their town as do notoriously and scandalously offend. They may imprison, fine, whip, and banish, but hang and quarter they may not; but must remit such cases to the Spanish governor. So likewise if a Spaniard passing by the town, or living in it, do trouble the peace, and demean himself, they may lay hold on him, and send him to the next Spanish justice, with a full information of his offence, but fine him, or keep him about one night in prison they may not. This order they have against Spaniards, but they dare not execute it, for a whole town standeth in awe of one Spaniard, and though he never so heinously offend, and be unruly, with oaths, threatenings, and drawing of his sword, he maketh them quake and tremble, and not presume to touch him; for they know if they do they shall have the worst, either by blows, or by some mis-information which he will give against them. And this hath been very often tried, for where Indians have by virtue of their order endeavoured to curb an unruly Spaniard in their town, some of them have been wounded, others beaten, and when they have carried the Spaniard before a Spanish justice and governor, he hath pleaded for what he hath done, saying it was in his own defence, or for his King and Sovereign, and that the Indians would have killed him, and began to mutiny all together against the Spanish authority and government, denying to serve him with what he needed for his way and journey; that they would not be slaves to give him or any Spaniard any attendance; and that they would make an end of him, and of all the Spaniards. With these and such-like false and lying mis-informations, the unruly Spaniards have often been believed, and too much upheld in their rude and uncivil misdemeanours, and the Indians bitterly curbed, and punished, and answer made them in such cases that if they had been killed for their mutiny and rebellion against the King, and his best subjects, they had been served well enough; and that if they gave not attendance unto the Spaniards that passed by their town, their houses should be fired, and they and their children utterly consumed. With such-like answers from the justices, and credency to what any base Spaniard shall inform against them, the poor Indians are fain to put up all wrongs done unto them, not daring to meddle with any Spaniard, be he never so unruly, by virtue of that order which they have against them.

Amongst themselves, if any complaint be made against any Indian, they dare not meddle with him until they call all his kindred, and especially the head of that tribe to which he belongeth; who if he and the rest together find him to deserve imprisonment, or whipping, or any other punishment, then the officers of justices, the alcaldes or mayors, and their brethren the jurats inflict upon him that punishment which all shall agree upon. But yet after judgment and sentence given, they have another, which is their last appeal, if they please, and that is to their priest and friar, who liveth in their town, by whom they will sometimes be judged, and undergo what punishment he shall think fittest. To the Church therefore they often resort in points of justice, thinking the priest knoweth more of law and equity than themselves; who sometimes reverseth what judgment hath been given in the town-house, blaming the officers for their partiality and passion against their poor brother, and setting free the party judged by them; which the priest does oftentimes, if such an Indian do belong to the church, or to the service of their house, or have any other relation to them, peradventure for their wife’s sake, whom either they affect, or employ in washing, or making their chocolate. Such, and their husbands, may live lawless as long as the priest is in the town. And if when the priest is absent, they call them to trial for any misdemeanour, and whip, fine, or imprison (which occasion they will sometimes pick out on purpose), when the priest returns, they shall be sure to hear of it, and smart for it, yea, and the officers themselves peradventure be whipped in the church, by the priest’s order and appointment; against whom they dare not speak, but willingly accept what stripes and punishment he layeth upon them, judging his wisdom, sentence, and punishing hand the wisdom, sentence, and hand of God; whom as they have been taught to be over all princes, judges, worldly officers, so likewise they believe (and have been so taught) that his priests and ministers are above theirs, and all worldly power and authority. It happened unto me living in the town of Mixco, that an Indian being judged to be whipped for some disorders which he committed, would not yield to the sentence, but appealed to me, saying he would have his stripes in the church, and by my order, for so he said his whipping would do him good as coming from the hand of God. When he was brought unto me, I could not reverse the Indian’s judgment, for it was just, and so caused him to be whipped, which he took very patiently and merrily, and after kissed my hands and gave me an offering of money for the good he said I had done unto his soul.

Besides this civility of justice amongst them, they live as in other civil and politic and well-governed commonwealths; for in most of their towns there are some that profess such trades as are practised among Spaniards. There are amongst them smiths, tailors, carpenters, masons, shoemakers, and the like. It was my fortune to set upon a hard and difficult building in a church of Mixco, where I desired to make a very broad and capacious vault over the chapel, which was the harder to be finished in a round circumference, because it depended upon a triangle, yet for this work I sought none but Indians, some of the town, some from other places, who made it so complete that the best and skilfullest workmen among the Spaniards had enough to wonder at it. So are most of their churches vaulted on the top, and all by Indians; they only in my time built a new cloister in the town of Amatitlán, which they finished with many arches of stone both in the lower walks and in the upper galleries, with as much perfection as the best cloister of Guatemala had before been built by the Spaniard. Were they more encouraged by the Spaniards, and taught better principles both for soul and body, doubtless they would among themselves make a very good commonwealth. For painting they are much inclined to it, and most of the pictures and altars of the country towns are their workmanship. In most of their towns they have a school, where they are taught to read, to sing, and some to write. To the church there do belong according as the town is in bigness, so many singers, and trumpeters, and waits, over whom the priest hath one officer, who is called fiscal; he goeth with a white staff with a little silver cross on the top to represent the church and shew that he is the priest’s clerk and officer. When any case is brought to be examined by the priest, this fiscal or clerk executeth justice by the priest’s order. He must be one that can read and write, and is commonly the master of music. He is bound upon the Lord’s Day and other saints’ days, to gather to the church before and after service all the young youths, and maids, and to teach them the prayers, sacraments, commandments, and other points of catechism allowed by the Church of Rome. In the morning he and the other musicians, at the sound of the bell, are bound to come to church to sing and officiate at Mass, which in many towns they perform with organs and other musical instruments (as hath been observed before) as well as Spaniards. So likewise at evening at five of the clock they are again to resort to the church, when the bell calleth, to sing prayers, which they call completas, or completory, with Salve Regina, a prayer to the Virgin Mary. This fiscal is a great man in the town, and bears more sway than the mayors, jurats, and other officers of justice, and when the priest is pleased, giveth attendance to him, goeth about his errands, appointeth such as are to wait on him when he rideth out of town. Both he and all that doth belong unto the church are exempted from the common weekly service of the Spaniards, and from giving attendance to travellers, and from other officers of justice. But they are to attend with their waits, trumpets, and music, upon any great man or priest that cometh to their town, and to make arches with boughs and flowers in the streets for their entertainment.

Besides these, those also that do belong unto the service of the priest’s house are privileged from the Spaniards’ service. Now the priest hath change of servants by the week, who take their turns so that they may have a week or two to spare to do their work. If it be a great town, he hath three cooks allowed him (if a small town, but two), men cooks who change their turns, except he have any occasion of feasting, then they all come. So likewise he hath two or three more (whom they call chahal) as butlers, who keep whatsoever provision is in the house under lock and key; and give to the cook what the priest appointeth to be dressed for his dinner or supper; these keep the table-cloths, napkins, dishes, and trenchers, and lay the cloth, and take away, and wait at the table; he hath besides three or four, and in great towns half a dozen, of boys to do his errands, wait at the table, and sleep in the house all the week by their turns, who with the cooks and butlers dine and sup constantly in the priest’s house, and at his charges. He hath also at dinner and supper times the attendance of some old women (who also take their turns) to oversee half a dozen young maids who next to the priest’s house do meet to make him and his family tortillas or cakes of maize, which the boys do bring hot to the table by half a dozen at a time. Besides these servants, if he have a garden he is allowed two or three gardeners; and for his stable, at least half a dozen Indians, who morning and evening are to bring him sacate (as there they call it) or herb and grass for his mules or horses, these diet not in the house; but the groom of the stable, who is to come at morning, noon, and evening (and therefore are three or four to change) or at any time that the priest will ride out, these I say and the gardeners (when they are at work) dine and sup at the priest’s charges; who sometimes in great towns hath above a dozen to feed and provide for. There are besides belonging to the church privileged from the weekly attendance upon the Spaniards two or three Indians called sacristanes, who have care of the vestry and copes, and altar cloths, and every day make ready the altar or altars for Mass; also to every company or sodality of the saints, or Virgin, there are two or three, whom they call mayordomos, who gather about the town alms for the maintaining of the sodality; these also gather eggs about the town for the priest every week, and give him an account of their gatherings, and allow him every month, or fortnight, two crowns for a Mass to be sung to the saint.

If there be any fishing place near the town, then the priest also is allowed for to seek him fish three or four, and in some places half a dozen Indians, besides the offerings in the church, and many other offerings which they bring whensoever they come to speak unto the priest, or to confess with him, or for a saint’s feast to be celebrated, and besides their tithes of everything there is a monthly maintenance in money allowed unto the priest, and brought unto him by the alcaldes, or mayors, and jurats, which he setteth his hand unto in a book of the town’s expenses. This maintenance (though it be allowed by the Spanish magistrate, and paid in the King’s name for the preaching of the Gospel) yet it comes out of the poor Indians’ purses and labour, and is either gathered about the town, or taken out of the tribute which they pay unto the King, or from a common plot of ground which with the help of all is sowed and gathered in and sold for that purpose.

All the towns in America, which are civilized and under the Spanish government, belong either to the Crown, or to some other lords, whom they call encomenderos, and pay a yearly tribute unto them. Those that are tenants to their lords or encomenderos (who commonly are such as descend from the first conquerors) pay yet unto the King some small tribute in money, besides what they pay in other kind of commodities unto their own encomendero and in money also. There is no town so poor, where every married Indian doth not pay at the least in money four reals a year for tribute to the King, besides other four reals to his lord, or encomendero. And if the town pay only to the King, they pay at least six, and in some places eight reals by statute, besides what other commodities are common to the town or country where they live, as maize (that is paid in all towns), honey, turkeys, fowls, salt, cacao, mantles of cotton-wool; and the like commodities they pay who are subject to an encomendero, but such pay only money, not commodities to the King. The mantles of tribute are much esteemed of, for they are choice ones, and of a bigger size than others, so likewise is the tribute cacao, achiote, cochineal, where it is paid, for the best is set apart for the tribute; and if the Indians bring that which is not prime good, they shall surely be lashed, and sent back for better. The heads of the several tribes have care to gather it, and to deliver it to the alcaldes and regidores, mayors and jurats, who carry it either to the King’s Exchequer in the city, or to the nearest Spanish justice (if it belong to the King), or to the lord, or encomendero of the town. In nothing I ever perceived the Spaniards merciful and indulgent unto the Indians, but in this, that if an Indian be very weak, poor, and sickly and not able to work, or threescore and ten years of age, he is freed from paying any tribute. There be also some towns privileged from this tribute; which are those that can prove themselves to have descended from Tlaxcala, or from certain tribes or families of or about Mexico, who helped the first Spaniards in the conquest of that country.

As for their carriage and behaviour, the Indians are very courteous and loving, and of timorous nature, and willing to serve and to obey, and to do good, if they be drawn by love; but where they are too much tyrannized, they are dogged, unwilling to please, or to work, and will choose rather strangling and death than life. They are very trusty, and never were known to commit any robbery of importance; so that the Spaniards dare trust to abide with them in a wilderness all night, though they have bags of gold about them. So for secrecy they are very close, and will not reveal anything against their own natives, or a Spaniard’s credit and reputation if they be any way affected to him. But above all unto their priest they are very respective unto him; and when they come to speak unto him, put on their best clothes, study their compliments and words to please him. They are very abundant in their expressions, and full of circumlocutions adorned with parables and similes to express their mind and intention. I have often sat still for the space of an hour, only hearing some old women make their speeches unto me, with so many elegancies in their tongue (which in English would be nonsense, or barbarous expressions) as would make me wonder, and learn by their speeches more of their language than by any other endeavour or study of mine own. And if I could reply unto them in the like phrases and expressions (which I would often endeavour) I should be sure to win their hearts, and get anything from them. As for their religion, they are outwardly such as the Spaniards, but inwardly hard to believe that which is above sense, nature, and the visible sight of the eye; and many of them to this day do incline to worship idols of stocks and stones, and are given to much superstition and to observe cross-ways, and meeting of beasts in them, the flying of birds, their appearing and singing near their houses at such and such times. Many are given to witchcraft, and are deluded by the devil to believe that their life dependeth upon the life of such and such a beast (which they take unto them as their familiar spirit) and think that when that beast dieth they must die, when he is chased their hearts pant, when he is faint they are faint, nay it happeneth that by the devil’s delusion they appear in the shape of that beast (which commonly by their choice is a buck, or doe, a lion, or tiger, or dog, or eagle) and in that shape have been shot at and wounded, as I shall shew in the chapter following. And for this reason (as I came to understand by some of them) they yield unto the Popish religion, especially to the worshipping of saints’ images, because they look upon them as much like unto their forefathers’ idols; and secondly, because they see some of them painted with beasts, as Hierome with a lion, Anthony with an ass, and other wild beasts, Dominic with a dog, Blas with a hog, Mark with a bull, and John with an eagle, they are more confirmed in their delusions, and think verily those saints were of their opinion, and that those beasts were their familiar spirits, in whose shape they also were transformed when they lived, and with whom they died.

All Indians are much affected unto these Popish saints, but especially those which are given to witchcraft, and out of the smallness of their means they will be sure to buy some of these saints and bring them to the church, that there they may stand and be worshipped by them and others. The churches are full of them, and they are placed upon standards gilded or painted, to be carried in procession upon men’s shoulders, upon their proper day. And from hence cometh no little profit to the priests; for upon such saints’ days, the owner of the saint maketh a great feast in the town, and presenteth unto the priest sometimes two or three, sometimes four or five crowns for his Mass and sermon, besides a turkey and three or four fowls, with as much cacao as will serve to make him chocolate for all the whole octave or eight days following. So that in some churches, where there are at least forty of these saints’ statues and images, they bring unto the priest at least forty pounds a year. The priest therefore is very watchful over those saints’ days, and sendeth warning before hand unto the Indians of the day of their saint, that they may provide themselves for the better celebrating it both at home and in the church. If they contribute not bountifully, then the priest will chide, and threaten that he will not preach. Some Indians through poverty have been unwilling to contribute anything at all, or to solemnize in the church and at his house his saint’s day, but then the priest hath threatened to cast his saint’s image out of the church, saying that the church ought not to be filled with such saints as are unprofitable to soul and body, and that in such a statue’s room one may stand which may do more good by occasioning a solemn celebration of one day more in the year. So likewise if the Indian that owned one of those images die and leave children, they are to take care of that saint as part of their inheritance, and to provide that his day be kept; but if no son, or heirs, be left, then the priest calleth for the heads of the several tribes, and for the chief officers of justice, and maketh a speech unto them, wherein he declareth that part of the church ground is taken up in vain by such an image, and his standard, without any profit either to the priest, the church, or the town, no heir or owner being left alive to provide for that orphan saint, to own it; and that in case they will not seek out who may take charge of him and of his day, the priest will not suffer him to stand idle in his church, like those whom our Saviour in the Gospel rebuked, quid hic statis tota die otiosi? for that they stood idle in the market all the day (these very expressions have I heard there from some friars) and therefore that he must banish such a saint’s picture out of the church, and must deliver him up before them into the justices’ hands to be kept by them in the town-house until such time as he may be bought and owned by some good Christian. The Indians when they hear these expressions begin to fear lest some judgment may befall their town for suffering a saint to be excommunicated and cast out of their church, and therefore present unto the priest some offering for his prayers unto the saint, that he may do them no harm, and desire him to limit them a time to bring him an answer for the disposing of that saint (thinking it will prove a disparagement and affront unto their town if what once hath belonged to the church be now out, and delivered up to the secular power) and that in the meantime they will find out some good Christian, either of the nearest friends and kindred to him or them who first owned the saint, or else some stranger, who may buy that saint of the priest (if he continue in the church) or of the secular power (if he be cast out of the church and delivered up unto them, which they are unwilling to yield to, having been taught of judgments in such a case like to befall them) and may by some speedy feast and solemnity appease the saint’s anger towards them, for having been so slighted by the town.

Alas poor Indians, what will they not be brought unto by those friars and priests, who study nothing more than their own ends, and to enrich themselves from the church and altar! Their policies (who are the wise and prudent children of this world spoken of in the Gospel) can easily overtop and master the simplicity of the poor Indians, who rather than they will bring an affront upon their town by suffering any of their saints to be cast out of their church, or to be with money redeemed out of the secular power’s hands, will make haste to present unto him an owner of that orphan saint, who for him shall give to the priest not only what he may be prized to be worth in a painter’s shop for the workmanship, gold, and colours belonging to him, but besides shall present him what before hath been observed, for the solemnizing of his feast. These feasts bring yet unto the saints more profit than hitherto hath been spoken of; for the Indians have been taught that upon such days they ought to offer up somewhat unto the saints; and therefore they prepare either money (some a real, some two, some more) or else commonly about Guatemala white wax candles, and in other places cacao, or fruits, which they lay before the image of the saint, whilst the Mass is celebrating. Some Indians will bring a bundle of candles of a dozen tied together of reals apiece some, some of three or four for a real, and will if they be let alone light them all together and burn them out, so that the priest at the end of the Mass will find nothing but the ends. Therefore (knowing well of the ways of policy and covetousness) he chargeth the church officers, whom I said before were called mayordomos to look to the offerings, and not to suffer the Indians who bring candles to light more than one before the saint, and to leave the other before him unlighted (having formerly taught them that the saints are as well pleased with their whole candles as with their burnt candles) that so he may have the more to sell and make money of. After Mass the priest and the mayordomos take and sweep away from the saint whatsoever they find hath been offered unto him; so that sometimes in a great town upon such a saint’s day the priest may have in money twelve or twenty reals, and fifty or a hundred candles, which may be worth unto him twenty or thirty shillings, besides some ends and pieces. Most of the friars about Guatemala are with those offerings as well stored with candles as is any wax-chandler’s shop in the city. And the same candles, which thus they have received by offerings, they need not care to sell them away to Spaniards, who come about to buy them (though some will rather sell them together to such though cheaper, that their money might come in all at once) for the Indians themselves when they want again any candles for the like feast, or for a christening, and for a woman’s churching (at which times they also offer candles) will buy their own again of the priest, who sometimes receiveth the same candles and money for them again five or six times. And because they find that the Indians incline very much to this kind of offerings, and that they are so profitable unto them, the friars do much press upon the Indians in their preaching this point of their religion and devotion.

But if you demand of these ignorant but zealous offerers, the Indians, an account of any point of faith, they will give you little or none. The mystery of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of Christ, and our redemption by him is too hard for them; they will only answer what they have been taught in a catechism of questions and answers; but if you ask them if they believe such a point of Christianity, they will never answer affirmatively, but only thus: ‘Perhaps it may be so.’ They are taught there the doctrine of Rome, that Christ’s body is truly and really present in the Sacrament, and no bread in substance, but only the accidents; if the wisest Indian be asked whether he believe this, he will answer: ‘Perhaps it may be so.’ Once an old woman, who was held to be very religious, in the town of Mixco, came to me about receiving the Sacrament, and whilst I was instructing of her, I asked her if she believed that Christ’s body was in the Sacrament, she answered: ‘Peradventure it may be so.’ A little while after to try her and get her out of this strain and common answer, I asked her what and who was in the Sacrament which she received from the priest’s hand at the altar; she answered nothing for a while, and at last I pressed upon her for an affirmative answer, and then she began to look about to the saints in the church (which was dedicated to a saint which they call St Dominic) and, as it seemed, being troubled and doubtful what to say, at last she cast her eyes upon the high altar; but I seeing she delayed the time, asked her again who was in the Sacrament? to which she replied St Dominic who was the patron of that church and town. At this I smiled, and would yet further try her simplicity with a simple question. I told her she saw St Dominic was painted with a dog by him holding a torch in his mouth, and the globe of the world at his feet; I asked her whether all this were with St Dominic in the Sacrament? To which she answered: ‘Perhaps it might be so’; wherewith I began to chide her, and to instruct her. But mine instruction, nor all the teaching and preaching of those Spanish priests hath not yet well grounded them in principles of faith; they are dull and heavy to believe or apprehend of God, or of heaven, more than with sense or reason they can conceive. Yet they go and run that way they see the Spaniards run, and as they are taught by their idolatrous priests. Who have taught them much formality, and so they are (as our Formalists formerly in England) very formal, but little substantial in religion.

They have been taught that when they come to confession they must offer somewhat to the priest, and that by their gifts and alms their sins shall be sooner forgiven; this they do formally observe that whensoever they come to confession, but especially in Lent, none of them dareth to come with empty hands; some bring money, some honey, some eggs, some fowls, some fish, some cacao, some one thing, some another, so that the priest hath a plentiful harvest in Lent for his pains in hearing their confessions. They have been taught that also when they receive the Communion they must surely every one give at least a real to the priest, (surely England was never taught in America to buy the Sacrament with a twopence offering, and yet this custom too much practised and pressed upon the people) which they perform so that I have known some poor Indians, who have for a week or two forborne from coming to the Communion until they could get a real offering. It is to be wondered what the priests do get from those poor wretches in great towns by confession and Communion reals in great towns, where they deny the Sacrament to none that will receive it (and in some towns I have known a thousand communicants) and force all above twelve or thirteen years of age to come to confession in the Lent.

They are very formal also in observing Rome’s Monday, Thursday, and Good Friday, and then they make their monuments and sepulchres, wherein they set their Sacrament, and watch it all day and night, placing before it a crucifix on the ground, with two basins on each side to hold the single or double reals which everyone must offer when he cometh creeping upon his knees and bare-footed to kiss Christ’s hands, feet, and side. The candles which for that day and night and next morning are burned at the sepulchre are bought with another contribution-real, which is gathered from house to house from every Indian for that purpose. Their religion is a dear and lick-penny religion for such poor Indians, and yet they are carried along in it formally and perceive it not. They are taught that they must remember the souls in Purgatory, and therefore that they must cast their alms into a chest, which standeth for that purpose in their churches, whereof the priest keepeth the key, and openeth it when he wanteth money, or when he pleaseth. I have often opened some of those chests, and have found in them many single reals, some half pieces of eight, and some whole pieces of eight. And because what is lost and found in the highways must belong to somebody, if the true owner be not known, they have been taught that such moneys or goods belong also to the souls departed; wherefore the Indians (surely more for fear or vanity’s sake that they may be well thought on by the priest) if they find anything lost will bestow it upon the souls surer than the Spaniards themselves (who if they find a purse lost will keep it) and will bring it either to the priest or cast it into the chest.

An Indian of Mixco had found a patacón or piece of eight in a highway, and when he came to confession he gave it unto me telling me he durst not keep it, lest the souls should appear unto him and demand it. So upon the second day of November which they call All Souls’ Day, they are extraordinary foolish and superstitious in offering moneys, fowls, eggs and maize, and other commodities for the souls’ good, but it proves for the profit of the priest, who after Mass wipes away to his chamber all that which the poor gulled and deluded Indians had offered unto those souls, which needed neither money, food, nor any other provision, and he fills his purse and pampers his belly with it. A friar that lived in Petapa boasted unto me once that upon their All Souls’ Day his offerings had been about a hundred reals, two hundred chickens and fowls, half a dozen turkeys, eight bushels of maize, three hundred eggs, four zontles of cacao (every zontle being four hundred grains), twenty clusters of plantains, above a hundred wax candles, besides some loaves of bread, and other trifles of fruits. All which being summed up according to the price of the things there, and with consideration of the coin of money there (half a real, or threepence, being there the least coin) mounts to above eight pounds of our money, a fair and goodly stipend for a Mass, brave wages for half an hour’s work; a politic ground for that error of Purgatory, if the dead bring to the living priest such wealth in one day only. Christmas Day with the rest of those holy days is no less superstitiously observed by these Indians, for against that time they frame and set in some corner of their church a little thatched house like a stall, which they call Bethlehem, with a blazing star over, pointing it unto the three sage wise men from the East; within this stall they lay in a crib a child made of wood, painted and gilded (who represents Christ new born unto them), by him stands Mary on the one side, and Joseph on the other, and an ass likewise on the one side and an ox on the other, made by hands, the three wise men of the East kneel before the crib offering gold, frankincense and myrrh, the shepherds stand off aloof offering their country gifts, some a kid, some a lamb, some milk, some cheese, and curds, some fruits, the fields are also there represented with flocks of sheep and goats; the angels they hang about the stall some with viols, some with lutes, some with harps, a goodly mumming and silent stage play, to draw those simple souls to look about, and to delight their senses and fantasies in the church.

There is not an Indian that cometh to see that supposed Bethlehem (and there is not any in the town but doth come to see it) who bringeth not either money or somewhat else for his offering. Nay the policy of the priests hath been such that (to stir up the Indians with their saints’ example) they have taught them to bring their saints upon all the holy days until Twelfth Day in procession unto this Bethlehem to offer their gifts, according to the number of the saints that stand in the church, some days there come five, some days eight, some days ten, dividing them into such order that by Twelfth Day all may have come and offered, some money, some one thing, some another. The owner of the saint, he cometh before the saint with his friends and kindred (if there be no sodality or company belonging unto that saint) and being very well apparelled for that purpose, he bows himself and kneels to the crib, and then rising takes from the saint what he bringeth and leaveth it there, and so departs. But if there be a sodality belonging to the saint, then the mayordomos or chief officers of that company they come before the saint, and do homage, and offer as before hath been said. But upon Twelfth Day the alcaldes, mayors, jurats, and other officers of justice must offer after the example of the saints, and the three wise men of the East (whom the Church of Rome teacheth to have been kings) because they represent the King’s power and authority. And all these days they have about the town and in the church a dance of shepherds, who at Christmas Eve at midnight begin before this Bethlehem, and then they must offer a sheep amongst them. Others dance clothed like angels and with wings, and all to draw the people more to see sights in the church than to worship God in spirit and in truth. Candlemas Day is no less superstitiously observed; for then the picture of Mary comes in procession to the altar, and offereth up her candles and pigeons or turtle-doves unto the priest, and all the town must imitate her example, and bring their candles to be blessed and hallowed; of four or five, or as many as they bring, one only shall be restored back unto them, because they are blessed, all the rest are for the priest, to whom the Indians resort after to buy them, and give more than ordinary, because they are hallowed candles.

At Whitsuntide they have another sight, and that is in the church also. Whilst a hymn is sung of the Holy Ghost, the priest standing before the altar with his face turned to the people, they have a device to let fall a dove from above over his head well dressed with flowers, and for above half an hour, from holes made for that purpose, they drop down flowers about the priest shewing the gifts of the Holy Ghost to him, which example the ignorant and simple Indians are willing to imitate, offering also their gifts unto him. Thus all the year are those priests and friars deluding the poor people for their ends, enriching themselves with their gifts, placing religion in mere policy; and thus doth the Indians’ religion consist more in sights, shows, and formalities, than in any true substance. But as sweet meat must have sour sauce, so this sweetness and pleasing delight of shows in the church hath its sour sauce once a year (besides the sourness of poverty which followeth to them by giving so many gifts unto the priest) for, to show that in their religion there is some bitterness and sourness they make the Indians whip themselves the week before Easter, like the Spaniards, which those simples both men and women perform with such cruelty to their own flesh that they butcher it, mangle and tear their backs, till some swoon, nay some (as I have known) have died under their own whipping, and have self-murdered themselves, which the priests regard not, because their death is sure to bring them at least three or four crowns for a Mass for their souls, and other offerings of their friends.

Thus in religion they are superstitiously led on and blinded in the observance of what they have been taught more for the good and profit of their priests than for any good of their souls, not perceiving that their religion is a policy to enrich their teachers. But not only do the friars and priests live by them and eat the sweat of their brows, but also all the Spaniards, who not only with their work and service (being themselves many given to idleness) grow wealthy and rich, but with needless offices and authority are still fleecing them, and taking from them that little which they gain with much hardness and severity.

The President of Guatemala, the judges of that Chancery, the governors and high justices of other parts of the country, that they may advance and enrich their menial servants, make the poor Indians the subject of their bountifulness towards such. Some have offices to visit as often as they please their towns, and to see what every Indian hath sowed of maize, for the maintenance of his wife and children; others visit them to see what fowls they keep for the good and store of the country; others have order to see whether their houses be decently kept and their beds orderly placed according to their families; others have power to call them out to mend and repair the highways; and others have commission to number the families and inhabitants of the several towns, to see how they increase that their tribute may not decrease, but still be raised. And all this, those officers do never perform but so that for their pains they must have from every Indian an allowance to bear their charges (which indeed are none at all), for as long as they stay in the town they may call for what fowls and provision they please without paying for it. When they come to number the towns, they call by list every Indian and cause his children, sons and daughters, to be brought before them, to see if they be fit to be married, and if they be of growth and age and be not married, the fathers are threatened for keeping them unmarried and as idle livers in the town without paying tribute; and according to the number of the sons and daughters that are marriageable, the father’s tribute is raised and increased until they provide husbands and wives for their sons and daughters, who as soon as they are married are charged with tribute; which that it may increase, they will suffer none above fifteen years of age to live unmarried. Nay the set time of age of marriage appointed for the Indians is at fourteen years for the man, and thirteen for the woman, alleging that they are sooner ripe for the fruit of wedlock, and sooner ripe in knowledge and malice, and strength for work and service, than are any other people. Nay sometimes they force them to marry who are scarce twelve and thirteen years of age, if they find them well limbed and strong in body, explicating a point of one of Rome’s canons, which alloweth fourteen and fifteen years, nisi malitia suppleat aetatem.

When I myself lived in Pinola, that town by order of Don Juan de Guzmán (a great gentleman of Guatemala, to whom it belonged) was numbered, and an increase of tributary Indians was added unto it by this means. The numbering it lasted a full week, and in that space I was commanded to join in marriage near twenty couple, which, with those that before had been married since the last numbering of it, made up to the encomendero or lord of it an increase of about fifty families. But it was a shame to see how young some were that at that time were forced to marriage, neither could all my striving and reasoning prevail to the contrary, nor the producing of the register book to shew their age, but that some were married of between twelve and thirteen years of age, and one especially who in the register book was found to be not fully of twelve years, whose knowledge and strength of body was judged to supply the want of age. In this manner even in the most free act of the will (which ought to be in marriage) are those poor Indians forced and made slaves by the Spaniards, to supply with tribute the want of their purses, and the meanness of their estates. Yet under this yoke and burden they are cheerful, and much given to feasting, sporting, and dancing, as they particularly shew in the chief feasts of their towns, which are kept upon that saint’s day to whom their town is dedicated. And certainly this superstition hath continued also in England from the Popish times, to keep fairs in many of our towns upon saints’ days (which is the intent of the Papists to draw in the people and country by way of commerce and trading one with another, to honour, worship, and pray to that saint to whom the town is dedicated) or else why are our fairs commonly kept upon John Baptist, James, Peter, Matthew, Bartholomew, Holy Rood, Lady days, and the like, and not as well a day or two before, or a day or two after, which would be as good and fit days to buy and sell as the other? True it is, our Reformation alloweth not the worshipping of saints, yet that solemn meeting of the people to fairs and mirth and sport upon those days it hath kept and continued, that so the saints and their days may be and continue still in our remembrance.

There is no town in the Indies great or small (though it be but of twenty families) which is not dedicated thus unto Our Lady or unto some saint, and the remembrance of that saint is continued in the minds not only of them that live in the town, but of all that live far and near by commercing, trading, sporting, and dancing, offering unto the saint, and bowing, kneeling, and praying before him. Before this day cometh, the Indians of the town two or three months have their meetings at night, and prepare themselves for such dances as are most commonly used amongst them; and in these their meetings they drink much both of chocolate and chicha. For every kind of dance they have several houses appointed, and masters of that dance, who teach the rest that they may be perfected in it against the saint’s day. For the most part of these two or three months the silence of the night is unquieted, what with their singing, what with their holloaing, what with their beating upon the shells of fishes, what with their waits, and what with their piping. And when the feast cometh, then they act publicly and for the space of eight days what privately they had practised before. They are that day well apparelled with silks, fine linen, ribbons and feathers according to the dance; which first they begin in the church before the saint, or in the churchyard, and from thence all the octave, or eight days, they go from house to house dancing, where they have chocolate or some heady drink or chicha given them. All those eight days the town is sure to be full of drunkards; and if they be reprehended for it they will answer that their heart doth rejoice with their saint in Heaven, and that they must drink unto him that he may remember them.

The chief dance used amongst them is called toncontin, which hath been danced before the King of Spain in the Court of Madrid by Spaniards, who have lived in the Indies, to shew unto the King somewhat of the Indians’ fashions; and it was reported to have pleased the King very much. This dance is thus performed. The Indians commonly that dance it (if it be a great town) are thirty or forty, or fewer if it be a small town. They are clothed in white, both their doublets, linen drawers, and ayates, or towels, which on the one side hang almost to the ground. Their drawers and ayates are wrought with some works of silk, or with birds, or bordered with some lace. Others procure doublets and drawers and ayates of silk, all which are hired for that purpose. On their backs they hang long tufts of feathers of all colours, which with glue are fastened into a little frame made for the purpose and gilded on the outside; this frame with ribbons they tie about their shoulders fast that it fall not, nor slacken with the motion of their bodies. Upon their heads they wear another less tuft of feathers either in their hats, or in some gilded or painted headpiece, or helmet. In their hands also they carry a fan of feathers, and on their feet most will use feathers also bound together like short wings of birds; some wear shoes, some not. And thus from top to toe they are almost covered with curious and coloured feathers. Their music and tune to this dance is only what is made with a hollow stock of a tree, being rounded and well pared within and without, very smooth and shining, some four times thicker than our viols, with two or three long clefts on the upper side and some holes at the end which they call tepanabaz. On this stock (which is placed upon a stool or form in the middle of the Indians) the master of the dance beats with two sticks, covered with wool at the ends, and a pitched leather over the wool that it fall not away. With this instrument and blows upon it (which soundeth but dull and heavy, but somewhat loud) he giveth the dancers their several tunes, and changes, and signs of the motion of their bodies either straight or bowing, and giveth them warning what and when they are to sing. Thus they dance in compass and circle round about that instrument, one following another sometimes straight, sometimes turning about, sometimes turning half way, sometimes bending their bodies and with the feathers in their hands almost touching the ground, and singing the life of that their saint, or of some other. All this dancing is but a kind of walking round, which they will continue two or three whole hours together in one place, and from thence go and perform the same at another house.

This toncontin the chief and principal only of the town do dance it; it was the old dance which they used before they knew Christianity, except that then instead of singing the saints’ lives they did sing the praises of their heathenish gods. They have another dance much used, which is a kind of hunting out some wild beast (which formerly in time of heathenism was to be sacrificed to their gods) to be offered up unto the saint. This dance hath much variety of tunes, with a small tepanabaz, and many shells of tortoises, or instead of them with pots covered with leather, on which they strike as on tepanabaz, and with the sound of pipes; in this dance they use much holloaing and noise and calling one unto another, and speaking by way of stage play, some relating one thing, some another concerning the beast they hunt after. These dancers are all clothed like beasts, with painted skins of lions, tigers, wolves, and on their heads such headpieces as may represent the head of such beasts, and others wear painted heads of eagles or fowls of rapine, and in their hands they have painted staves, bills, swords, and axes, wherewith they threaten to kill that beast they hunt after. Others instead of hunting after a beast, hunt after a man, as beasts in a wilderness should hunt a man to kill him. This man that is thus hunted after must be very nimble and agile, as one flying for his life, and striking here and there at the beasts for his defence, whom at last they catch and make a prey of. As the toncontin consists most of walking and turning and leisurely bending their bodies, so this dance doth wholly consist in action, running in a circle round, sometimes out of circle, and leaping and striking with those tools and instruments which they have in their hand. This is a very rude sport, and full of shrieking and hideous noise, wherein I never delighted.

Another Mexican dance they use, some clothed like men, others like women, which in heathenish times they did use with singing praises unto their king or emperor; but now they apply their songs unto the King of Glory, or unto the Sacrament, using these or commonly the like words with very little difference, and some variety of praise.

Salid Mexicanas, bailad Toncontin.
Cansalas galanas en cuerpo gentil. And again, Salid Mexicanas, bailad Toncontin.
Aquí la gloria tenemos aquí.

Thus they go round dancing, playing in some places very well upon their guitars, repeating now and then all together a verse or two, and calling the Mexican dames to come out to them with their gallant mantles to sing praise unto their King of Glory. Besides these they have, and use our Morris dances, and blackamoor dances with sonajas in their hands, which are a round set of small Morris dancing bells, wherewith they make variety of sounds to their nimble feet. But the dance which doth draw to it the people’s wondering is a tragedy acted by way of dance, as the death of St Peter, or the beheading of John the Baptist. In these dances there is an Emperor, or a King Herod, with their Queens clothed, another clothed with a long loose coat who represents St Peter, or John the Baptist, who whilst the rest danceth, walketh amongst them with a book in his hands, as if he were saying his prayers, all the rest of the dancers are apparelled like captains and soldiers with swords, daggers, or halberds in their hands. They dance at the sound of a small drum and pipes, sometimes round, sometimes in length forward, and have and use many speeches to the Emperor or King, and among themselves concerning the apprehending and executing the saint. The King and Queen sit sometimes down to hear their pleading against the saint, and his pleading for himself; and sometimes they dance with the rest; and the end of their dance is to crucify St Peter downwards with his head upon a cross, or behead John the Baptist, having in readiness a painted head in a dish which they present unto the King and Queen, for joy whereof they all again dance merrily and so conclude, taking down him that acted Peter from the cross. The Indians that dance this dance most of them are superstitious for what they do, judging as if it were indeed really acted and performed what only is by way of dance represented. When I lived amongst them it was an ordinary thing for him who in the dance was to act St Peter or John the Baptist to come first to confession, saying they must be holy and pure like that saint, whom they represent, and must prepare themselves to die. So likewise he that acted Herod or Herodias, and some of the soldiers that in the dance were to speak and to accuse the saints, would afterwards come to confess of that sin, and desire absolution as from bloodguiltiness. More particular passages of the Indians according to my experience of them I shall in the chapter following truly relate unto my reader.
