# Lesson Plan: Unit 3, Lesson 2 - Colonial Life in Guatemala

## Overview
This lesson explores colonial life in Guatemala for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student, focusing on daily routines and architecture after the Spanish arrival, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through crafting a colonial window, a dictation exercise, and narration, the student will deepen their understanding of the colonial period. Using Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—hands-on activities, narration, and short lessons—it’s engaging and tailored to the student in San Juan del Obispo, near Antigua, connecting history to local colonial landmarks and building on Lesson 1’s introduction.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Narration**: Encourages oral retelling of the lesson content, enhancing comprehension and memory.
- **Short Lessons**: Limits activities to concise segments (e.g., 5-minute dictation) to maintain focus.
- **Hands-On**: Uses a craft to connect kinesthetic learning with historical content.
- **Dictation**: Includes a dictation exercise with a historical sentence to practice spelling and reinforce colonial themes, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s method of engaging with content through writing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:
1. Describe aspects of colonial life (e.g., architecture, daily routines) in simple terms.
2. Color a colonial scene to represent Spanish-influenced buildings and life.
3. Write a dictated sentence about colonial life with correct spelling.
4. Narrate elements in their colored colonial scene, connecting it to colonial life.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Coloring Page**: Colonial scene from `resources/colonial_coloring_page.md` (printable or hand-drawn).
- **Crayons or Colored Pencils**: For coloring (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Dictation Sentence**: "The church bells rang." (English) or "Las campanas sonaron." (Spanish), reflecting colonial life and sourced from historical context.
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation exercise (household items).
- **Optional**: Images of colonial architecture (e.g., search "Antigua Guatemala colonial buildings" online; free).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from `resources/timeline_template.pdf` for adding a drawing.
- **Accessibility**: Uses low-cost, common materials; substitutes (e.g., plain paper, pencils) work if needed.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Introduce colonial life and the coloring activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Lesson 1: "When the Spanish came, they built towns. Today, we'll see how people lived in these colonial towns."
     - Say, "They made houses and churches with special architecture. We'll color a colonial scene and write about their life!"
     - Show optional images of colonial architecture if available.
2. **Main Activity (40 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore colonial life through coloring, listening to an audio narration, and discussion.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Listening (15 minutes)**:
       - **Objective**: Practice listening and introduce historical content.
       - **Procedure**:
         - Follow the instructions to setup and listen to one or both of the following audio adaptations:
            - [Simplified version of The English-American: a new survey of the West Indies, 1648](resources/A_new_survey_of_the_West_Indies_Simplified.md) — a vibrant and rich description of the geography of Santiago de los Caballeros (Antigua) and the brutality of life under Spanish colonial rule (**English**).
            - [Simplified version of Breve descripcion de la noble ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala](resources/Breve_descripcion_de_Santiago_de_los_Caballeros_Simplified.md) — a beautiful description of Santiago de los Caballeros (Antigua) and the Earthquake of 1773 (**Spanish**).
      - **Discussion (10 minutes)**: Talk about colonial life:
      - **Coloring (15 minutes)**: Provide the colonial coloring page. Say, "Color this colonial town scene!" As they color, discuss the different elements in the scene: "What buildings do you see? What might people be doing in this town?"”
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, "What's happening in your colored scene?" or "Tell me a story about the people who might live here."
     - Encourage imaginative responses tied to colonial life (e.g., "Spanish people live here"). Note a key idea (e.g., "Church was important") for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview the field trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Colonial life had new buildings and ways of living, like hearing church bells.”
     - Preview, "Next, we'll visit the [Iximché Ruins](field_trip.md) to see where the Maya lived during colonial times!"
     - **Update Timeline**: Add a colonial building sketch to the Colonial section with the student.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Coloring**: Color a colonial scene to explore architecture and daily life (15 minutes).
  - **Dictation**: Write a sentence to practice spelling and connect to colonial life (5 minutes).
  - **Discussion**: Talk about colonial routines to build context (10 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Coloring**: Observe effort; ask, "What do you see in this colonial town?" to check understanding.
  - **Dictation**: Check the written sentence for spelling accuracy and neatness (e.g., correct spelling of "bells" or "campanas").
  - **Narration**: Listen for life details (e.g., buildings, routines) in retelling.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect the colored page and dictation sentence for the portfolio, assessing participation and comprehension informally based on effort and engagement.
  - In Week 10, review timeline additions for Unit 3 connection; no formal rubric.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Add detailed elements to their coloring or narrate a complex scene (e.g., "A market in the town square"); write an additional dictation sentence.
- **Struggling Learners**: Pre-color parts of the page; simplify narration to "What's happening in this picture?"; allow tracing for dictation.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out a scene from colonial life after coloring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images to inspire coloring details and discussion.

## Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 40 minutes (15 min coloring, 5 min dictation, 10 min discussion)
- Narration: 10 minutes
- Closing: 5 minutes
- Total: 60 minutes (extended from 45 minutes to include dictation without cutting other sections)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic coloring and writing skills (with help); Spanish arrival from Lesson 1.
- **Parent**: Ability to supervise scissors, guide craft, and conduct dictation; no prior knowledge needed.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Prepare coloring page and supplies (~5 minutes).
- **Facilitation**: Provide coloring guidance, dictate the sentence clearly, guide discussion, and prompt narration.
- **Engagement**: Ask, "What do you hear when bells ring in our town?" to connect to history.
- **Follow-Up**: Store the colored page and dictation sentence in the portfolio and update the timeline.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use high-contrast colors; describe elements of the coloring page aloud.
- **Motor Challenges**: Provide thicker crayons; assist with coloring or writing; use larger printouts if needed.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten coloring to 10 minutes with a break; adjust dictation pace.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., "edificio/building," "campanas/bells"); allow dictation in preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to basic coloring supplies; plain paper and pencils can substitute if needed.
- Builds on Lesson 1; recap Spanish arrival if missed.
