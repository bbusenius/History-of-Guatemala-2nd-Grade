# Unit 3, Lesson 2: Continuation of the Spanish Conquest

### Overview
This lesson introduces the Spanish arrival in Guatemala, marking the colonial period’s start, within a 10-week homeschool curriculum for a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo. Through storytelling with a living book excerpt, picture study, dictation, coloring, and a discussion question reflecting Maya perspectives, the student explores the Spanish-Maya encounter. Aligned with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, living books/primary sources, and hands-on activities—it connects to local heritage near Antigua, fostering cultural sensitivity by considering indigenous viewpoints alongside colonial narratives.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses *The Annals of the Cakchiquels* excerpts for narrative depth, bringing history to life authentically.
- **Narration**: Encourages retelling and discussion to enhance comprehension and empathy.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments activities (e.g., 5-minute picture study) for focus.
- **Picture Study**: Includes a colonial painting to develop observation and cultural context.
- **Hands-On**: Features coloring to engage kinesthetic learners.
- **Dictation**: Links writing to historical content for meaningful practice.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Adds a Maya perspective to balance narratives and respect indigenous views.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand that the Spanish arrived in Guatemala in the early 16th century, initiating the colonial period.
2. Retell key elements of the Spanish arrival story.
3. Know who is Pedro de Alvarado and that his name was Tunatiuh Avilantaro to the Kaqchikel people.
4. Observe and describe features of a colonial painting (e.g., colors, objects).
5. Write a dictated sentence about the arrival with correct spelling.
6. Reflect on how the Maya might have felt about the Spanish through a discussion question.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Living Books**: A 5-10 minute excerpt from:
  - **Required**:
    - *The Annals of the Cakchiquels* translated by Daniel G. Brinton (English, available on [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13993465M/The_annals_of_the_Cakchiquels)), focusing on **pages 177-193** where it discusses the arrival of the Spanish (referred to as Castilians). **Note**: "Tunatiuh Avilantaro" refers to [Pedro de Alvarado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado). 
  - **Optional**: *On the Province and Kingdom of Guatemala* from *An account, much abbreviated, of the destruction of the Indies, with related texts* by  Bartolomé de las Casas (pages 38-43) [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL957329W/An_account_much_abbreviated_of_the_destruction_of_the_Indies_with_related_texts).

- **Picture Study Image**: Wall paintings from a house in Chajul, Guatemala, depicting the Spanish influence on Maya culture. [View the image](https://cdn.sci.news/images/enlarge7/image_8558_1e-Chajul-Paintings.jpg) and [read more about it](https://www.sci.news/archaeology/chajul-maya-wall-paintings-guatemala-08558.html). The panel likely shows figures dancing the Conquista, a traditional dance still performed today, featuring two musicians in Spanish costumes playing a flute or chirimía and a large drum, and a man in Indian-Spanish attire possibly holding a bottle, showing a blend of European and indigenous elements.
- **Dictation Sentence**: "On the day one the Quiches were destroyed by the Spanish. Pedro de Alvarado conquered all the towns." (English) or "El primer día, los quichés fueron destruidos por los españoles. Pedro de Alvarado conquistó todas las ciudades." (Spanish)
- **Coloring Page**: Colonial scene from [resources/colonial_coloring_page.md](resources/colonial_coloring_page.md) (printable or hand-drawn).
- **Crayons or Colored Pencils**: For coloring (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Paper and Pencil**: For dictation (household items).
- **Optional Visuals**: Spanish ship images (e.g., search “Spanish galleon for kids” online; free).
- **Timeline**: Reusable timeline from [resources/timeline_template.pdf](resources/timeline_template.pdf).
- **Accessibility**: Ebooks prioritized; coloring page drawable if no printer; low-cost materials.

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Set the stage and engage interest.
   - **Procedure**:
     - After the Spanish conquored the K'iche people, they conquered the Kaqchikel people.
2. **Main Activity (40 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the encounter through narrative and activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling (20 minutes)**: Read [The Annals of the Cakchiquels](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13993465M/The_annals_of_the_Cakchiquels) (e.g., pages 177-193). Ask, “What did the Spanish do when they arrived?”
        - **Note**: "Tunatiuh Avilantaro" refers to [Pedro de Alvarado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado). Make sure the student understands this. Consider discussing Pedro de Alvarado in more detail.
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the [Chajul mural image](https://cdn.sci.news/images/enlarge7/image_8558_1e-Chajul-Paintings.jpg). Say, “Look for 2 minutes. Notice people and things.” After, cover it and ask, “What did you see?” Then, uncover and discuss: “Who’s in this picture? What are they doing? Do you see Spanish and Maya styles mixed?” Consider reading [this article](https://www.sci.news/archaeology/chajul-maya-wall-paintings-guatemala-08558.html) to the child for more information.
     - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Dictate "On the day one the Quiches were destroyed by the Spanish. Pedro de Alvarado conquered all the towns." (English) or "El primer día, los quichés fueron destruidos por los españoles. Pedro de Alvarado conquistó todas las ciudades." (Spanish), slowly. Check spelling and praise effort.
     - **Coloring (10 minutes)**: Provide the [coloring page](https://colorconfetti.com/img/guatemala-coloring-page-w3.png). Say, “Color this colonial town—like where the Spanish landed!” Ask, “What buildings do you see?”
3. **Narration and Discussion (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect on learning and Maya perspectives.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “What happened when the Spanish came?” Listen for story details (e.g., “They came on ships”).
     - Ask, “How do you think the Maya felt when the Spanish arrived?” Encourage empathy (e.g., “Scared” or “Curious”). Suggest, “Think how you’d feel if strangers came to our town.”
     - Note a key response (e.g., “The Maya were surprised”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The Spanish changed Guatemala, and the Maya had their own feelings about it.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll see how people lived after they came!”
     -  **Update timeline**: Add a ship sketch to the timeline’s Colonial section with the student.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (20 minutes)**: Listening to a narrative about the Spanish arrival.
  - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Observing a colonial painting.
  - **Dictation (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence about the arrival.
  - **Coloring (10 minutes)**: Coloring a colonial scene.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling**: Check narration for details (e.g., ships, Spanish) to assess comprehension.
  - **Picture Study**: Evaluate observations (e.g., “Men with hats”) for detail.
  - **Dictation**: Verify spelling accuracy (e.g., “ship” or “barco” correct).
  - **Discussion**: Note empathy in responses (e.g., “The Maya were scared”) to assess perspective-taking.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect dictation and coloring for the portfolio, assessing participation and connection informally (no rubric; based on effort and inclusion of key ideas).
  - In Week 10, review timeline for Unit 3 connection.

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate extra details (e.g., “They built towns”); label coloring page elements. Consider watching [La conquista de Guatemala: la historia de Pedro de Alvarado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FvVdIKhkdM), reading his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Alvarado#Conquest_of_Soconusco_and_Guatemala), or engaging with AI to learn more about Pedro de Alvarado. Also consider breaking this out into a separate lesson about Pedro de Alvarado or reading the [optional reading selection](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL957329W/An_account_much_abbreviated_of_the_destruction_of_the_Indies_with_related_texts) (pages 38-43).
- **Struggling Learners**: Simplify narration to “Who came?”; pre-color parts of the page.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Act out ships landing during narration.
- **Visual Learners**: Use ship images to inspire coloring.
