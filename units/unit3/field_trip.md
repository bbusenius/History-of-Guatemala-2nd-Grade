# Field Trip Plan: Unit 3 - Iximché Ruins

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on Maya history through the Iximché Ruins in Tecpán, Chimaltenango. This trip connects Lesson 3 (reading of 'Anales de los Cakchiqueles') to a real-world site, using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration. Designed as an optional outing with flexible duration (3-4 hours), it leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of Maya ruins.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to local Maya heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Recognize significant elements of a Maya city (e.g., temples, ball courts) at Iximché Ruins.
2. Connect observations from the site to Unit 3 lessons on Maya history from 'Anales de los Cakchiqueles'.
3. Sketch a feature from the ruins, demonstrating engagement with the historical context.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Iximché Ruins (~1.5 hours from San Juan del Obispo).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos, binoculars for details (household).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; entry to Iximché Ruins is ~$3-$5 (verify); transportation costs vary (e.g., bus fare ~$1-$2 per location).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30-45 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure a safe, educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and say, “We’re visiting the Iximché Ruins where the Maya lived, connecting to our readings!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a bag.
     - Plan transportation and check site hours (Iximché: 8 AM - 4 PM daily).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at Iximché; locate the main plaza: “This was a Maya city with homes and temples.”
     - Say, “This connects to ‘Anales de los Cakchiqueles.’ Let’s explore and draw something.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1.5-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Visit the main plaza, temples, and ball courts, noting structures.
     - Ask, “What do you think the Maya did here?” (e.g., “Played games in the ball court”).
     - Sketch one feature (e.g., a temple) in 15-20 minutes.
     - Allow free exploration if time remains.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15-30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch: “What did you draw? Why?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn about the Maya?” and depart with all items.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one feature from Iximché Ruins (e.g., temple or ball court) in 15-20 minutes, noting its use (e.g., “For ceremonies”).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to wrap-up reflections (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the sketch for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess recall and connection to lessons informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple features or add notes (e.g., “This temple was for a king”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw basic shapes (e.g., a square temple); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to features while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or binoculars for detail focus.
