# Field Trip Plan: Unit 3 - Colonial Antigua: Catedral de San José

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum on Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the colonial period, specifically Spanish architecture and life, by visiting the Catedral de San José in Antigua, Guatemala. The trip connects Lessons 1 and 2 (Spanish arrival and colonial life) to a real-world site, using Charlotte Mason-inspired observation and narration. Designed as an optional 2-3 hour outing, it leverages the student’s proximity to San Juan del Obispo, requiring minimal preparation and offering a virtual alternative.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing historical understanding through observation of colonial architecture.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussion, a Charlotte Mason focus.
- Integrating art through sketching, supporting cross-subject goals (art).
- Promoting cultural appreciation by connecting to local colonial heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify key features of colonial architecture (e.g., arches, bell towers) at the cathedral.
2. Connect the cathedral to Lessons 1-2 about Spanish arrival and colonial life.
3. Sketch a cathedral feature, demonstrating engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing/shoes, transportation to Antigua (e.g., bus or car from San Juan del Obispo).
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or paper), pencils, crayons (household or ~$2-$5).
- **Optional**: Camera/smartphone for photos, binoculars for details (household).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost materials; entry to the cathedral is free or a small donation (~$1-$2, verify); transportation costs vary (e.g., bus fare ~$1-$2).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure a safe, educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this plan and say, “We’re visiting a big church the Spanish built!”
     - Pack water, snacks, sketchbook, pencils in a bag.
     - Plan transportation (~15-30 minutes from San Juan del Obispo); check cathedral hours.
2. **Arrival and Orientation (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at the cathedral; point out features: “Look at the big doors and tower!”
     - Say, “This is from colonial times. We’ll draw something you like.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site and sketch.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Explore the facade, towers, and interior (if open), noting details (e.g., arches).
     - Ask, “What do you think this was used for?” (e.g., “Church for praying”).
     - Sketch one feature (e.g., a window) in 15-20 minutes; encourage simple lines/colors.
     - Allow free exploration if time remains.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect and leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch: “What did you draw? Why?”
     - Ask, “What did you learn?” and depart with all items.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Sketch one cathedral feature (e.g., window, tower) in 15-20 minutes, noting its use (e.g., “For bells”).
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe engagement; listen to wrap-up reflections (e.g., “What did you see?”).
- **Summative Assessment**: Collect the sketch for the portfolio; use post-trip discussion to assess recall and connection to lessons informally.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Sketch multiple features or add notes (e.g., “This is old”).
- **Struggling Learners**: Draw basic shapes (e.g., a square window); use a camera instead.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Point to features while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**: Use photos or binoculars for detail focus.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 30 minutes
- Arrival/Orientation: 10 minutes
- Exploration/Activity: 1-2 hours

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe features aloud; use binoculars.
