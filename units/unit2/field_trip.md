# Field Trip Plan: Unit 2 - Casa K’ojom

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum exploring Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the Maya civilization’s daily life and achievements, providing hands-on opportunities to connect classroom learning from Unit 2 (Maya Civilization - Daily Life and Achievements) with real-world experiences near Antigua, Guatemala. The trip includes a visit to Casa K’ojom for deep Maya culture exploration, incorporating Charlotte Mason-inspired methods like observation and narration. Designed to be flexible and requiring minimal preparation, this 1-2 hour optional field trip enhances the student’s understanding, leveraging their proximity to San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements, emphasizing flexible, child-centered learning inspired by Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. It does not follow Common Core State Standards, as specified in the course rules. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through direct observation of Maya cultural exhibits.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussions, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s focus on oral expression.
- Integrating cross-curricular elements (e.g., geography through site location, art through sketching) to meet broad homeschool learning objectives.
- Promoting cultural appreciation, connecting the student to their local and national Maya heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least two key features of Maya culture (e.g., music, artifacts) observed at Casa K’ojom.
2. Connect observations from Casa K’ojom to prior lessons about Maya daily life and achievements.
3. Complete a simple sketch of one cultural artifact to demonstrate engagement with the site.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe and educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this field trip plan and explain the purpose: “We’re visiting Casa K’ojom to learn more about Maya culture.”
     - Gather materials (sketchbook, pencils, water, snacks) and pack them in a backpack.
     - Check current site hours for Casa K’ojom (Tuesday to Sunday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at Casa K’ojom and locate the main exhibit hall.
     - Provide a brief overview: “Here, we’ll see Maya music and artifacts.”
     - Set expectations: “We’ll explore and draw one thing you like.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-1.5 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site and complete the sketching activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Guide the student through key areas: explore music exhibits and artifacts at Casa K’ojom.
     - Encourage observation: “What does this instrument sound like?”
     - Supervise the sketching activity: Choose one feature (e.g., marimba, pottery) to draw, noting details (e.g., “It’s used for music”). Allow 15-20 minutes for sketching.
     - Explore additional areas if time permits, noting interesting finds for discussion.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect briefly and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch and ask, “What did you learn about the Maya today?”
     - Discuss one observation (e.g., “This drum is for ceremonies”).
     - Depart the site, ensuring all belongings are collected.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - Sketch one cultural artifact at Casa K’ojom (e.g., marimba, pottery), noting its possible use (e.g., “For music”). Takes 15-20 minutes during exploration.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe engagement during sketching (e.g., focus, curiosity).
  - Listen to initial reflections at wrap-up (e.g., “What did you see?”) to gauge understanding of Maya life or culture.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Use the sketch and “Post-Trip Discussion” questions at home to assess recall and connection to Unit 2 lessons.
  - Collect the sketch for the portfolio, evaluating participation and basic comprehension informally (no rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Sketch multiple features or add a short written note (e.g., “This flute is old”).
  - Encourage detailed observations (e.g., “How do you think they made this?”).
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Simplify to sketching basic shapes; use a camera to capture instead, discussing later.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Encourage walking around or pointing to features while exploring.
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Use photos taken during the trip to focus on details.
