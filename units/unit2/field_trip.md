# Field Trip Plan: Unit 2 - Iximché Ruins and Optional Casa K’ojom

## Overview
This field trip is part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum exploring Guatemalan history for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student. It focuses on the Maya civilization’s daily life and achievements, providing hands-on opportunities to connect classroom learning from Unit 2 (Maya Civilization - Daily Life and Achievements) with real-world experiences near Antigua, Guatemala. The trip includes a visit to Iximché Ruins and an optional visit to Casa K’ojom for deeper Maya culture exploration, incorporating Charlotte Mason-inspired methods like observation and narration. Designed to be flexible and requiring minimal preparation, this 2-3 hour optional field trip enhances the student’s understanding, leveraging their proximity to San Juan del Obispo.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements, emphasizing flexible, child-centered learning inspired by Charlotte Mason’s philosophy. It does not follow Common Core State Standards, as specified in the course rules. The field trip supports educational goals by:
- Reinforcing chronological understanding of Guatemalan history through direct observation of Maya ruins and cultural exhibits.
- Encouraging narrative skills via post-trip discussions, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s focus on oral expression.
- Integrating cross-curricular elements (e.g., geography through site location, art through sketching) to meet broad homeschool learning objectives.
- Promoting cultural appreciation, connecting the student to their local and national Maya heritage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the field trip, the student will be able to:
1. Identify at least two key features of a Maya city (e.g., temples, ball courts) observed at Iximché Ruins.
2. Connect observations from the ruins or Casa K’ojom to prior lessons about Maya daily life and achievements.
3. Complete a simple sketch of one ruin feature or cultural artifact to demonstrate engagement with the site.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Field Trip Essentials**: Water, snacks, comfortable clothing and shoes, transportation to Iximché Ruins (~1.5 hours) or Casa K’ojom (~15-30 minutes) from San Juan del Obispo.
- **Activity Materials**: Sketchbook (or plain paper), pencils, crayons.
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for safety and engagement tips (provided in curriculum).
- **Optional**: Camera or smartphone for photos (to aid post-trip narration), binoculars for detailed viewing of ruins or exhibits.
- **Accessibility**: Most materials are household items; entry fees are ~$3-$5 for Iximché, ~$3 for Casa K’ojom (verify current rates); transportation costs vary based on method (e.g., gas or bus fare).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (30 minutes, before departure)**:
   - **Objective**: Ensure readiness for a safe and educational trip.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review this field trip plan and explain the purpose: “We’re visiting Iximché Ruins to see a real Maya city, and optionally Casa K’ojom to learn more about Maya culture.”
     - Gather materials (sketchbook, pencils, water, snacks) and pack them in a backpack.
     - Choose between Iximché Ruins (1.5 hours by car or bus) or Casa K’ojom (closer, ~15-30 minutes); check current site hours (Iximché: 8 AM - 4 PM, Casa K’ojom: Tuesday to Sunday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM).
2. **Arrival and Orientation (15 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Familiarize the student with the chosen site.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Arrive at Iximché Ruins or Casa K’ojom and locate the main area (plaza for ruins, exhibit hall for Casa K’ojom).
     - Provide a brief overview: “This was a Maya city with homes and temples” (Iximché) or “Here, we’ll see Maya music and artifacts” (Casa K’ojom).
     - Set expectations: “We’ll explore and draw one thing you like.”
3. **Exploration and Activity (1-2 hours)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage with the site and complete the sketching activity.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Guide the student through key areas: at Iximché, visit the main plaza, temples, and ball courts; at Casa K’ojom, explore music exhibits and artifacts.
     - Encourage observation: “What do you think this building was for?” (Iximché) or “What does this instrument sound like?” (Casa K’ojom).
     - Supervise the sketching activity: Choose one feature (e.g., temple at Iximché, marimba at Casa K’ojom) to draw, noting details (e.g., “It’s tall with steps”). Allow 15-20 minutes for sketching.
     - Explore additional areas if time permits, noting interesting finds for discussion.
4. **Wrap-Up and Departure (15-30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reflect briefly and prepare to leave.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Review the sketch and ask, “What did you learn about the Maya today?”
     - Discuss one observation (e.g., “This ball court was for games” at Iximché, or “This drum is for ceremonies” at Casa K’ojom).
     - Depart the site, ensuring all belongings are collected.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**:
  - Sketch one feature of the ruins (e.g., temple, ball court) or a cultural artifact at Casa K’ojom (e.g., marimba, pottery), noting its possible use (e.g., “For praying” or “For music”). Takes 15-20 minutes during exploration.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Observe engagement during sketching (e.g., focus, curiosity).
  - Listen to initial reflections at wrap-up (e.g., “What did you see?”) to gauge understanding of Maya life or culture.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Use the sketch and “Post-Trip Discussion” questions at home to assess recall and connection to Unit 2 lessons.
  - Collect the sketch for the portfolio, evaluating participation and basic comprehension informally (no rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Sketch multiple features or add a short written note (e.g., “This temple was for a king” at Iximché, or “This flute is old” at Casa K’ojom).
  - Encourage detailed observations (e.g., “How do you think they built this?”).
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Simplify to sketching basic shapes (e.g., a square for a temple); use a camera to capture instead, discussing later.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Encourage walking around or pointing to features while exploring at both sites.
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Use photos taken during the trip or binoculars to focus on details at both locations.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 30 minutes (before departure)
- Arrival and Orientation: 15 minutes
- Exploration and Activity: 1-2 hours
- Wrap-Up and Departure: 15-30 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (flexible based on chosen site and parent’s schedule)

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic observation and drawing skills (developed in Unit 1’s activities); familiarity with Maya daily life and achievements from Unit 2, Lessons 1 and 2.
- **Parent**: Ability to plan logistics (e.g., transportation, timing); basic facilitation skills (e.g., guiding observation, prompting questions).

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Review this plan, gather materials, and arrange transportation to Iximché Ruins or Casa K’ojom (e.g., car or bus).
- **Facilitation**: Accompany the student, guide them through exhibits or ruins, and assist with sketching.
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing observations (e.g., “What do you think this place was used for?”).
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct the post-trip discussion at home and store the sketch in the student’s portfolio.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Describe features aloud at both sites; use binoculars for distant details at Iximché.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with sketching at both locations; use a camera instead if needed.
- **Attention Span**: Shorten the visit to 1-1.5 hours at either site or take a snack break midway.
- **Language Support**: Use bilingual terms (e.g., “ruinas/ruins,” “música/music”) to reinforce learning.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes transportation feasibility (Iximché ~1.5 hours, Casa K’ojom ~15-30 minutes); adjust logistics if further.
- Assumes site accessibility; parents must verify hours and fees in advance.
- Assumes access to basic materials; borrow from a library if needed.
- Weather may affect outdoor exploration at Iximché; virtual alternatives mitigate this.
