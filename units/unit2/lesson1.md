# Lesson Plan: Unit 2, Lesson 1 - Maya Achievements and Calendar

### Overview
This lesson introduces the Maya civilization’s achievements, particularly their calendar system, to a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, as part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through a video, an outdoor shadow-casting observation, picture study, and coloring, the student explores the calendar’s cultural significance. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, short lessons, and hands-on activities—it integrates an indigenous viewpoint to balance historical narratives, enhancing cultural sensitivity and connecting to the student’s heritage near Antigua.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Video**: [¿Por qué el CALENDARIO MAYA es tan preciso? Tzolkin, Haab y la Cuenta Larga](https://youtu.be/GgptPdr7yFQ?si=AC9Zrxyb6Y81UsaR). Covers the Tzolkin and Haab calendars, what they were used for and how they were important to the Maya.
- **Narration**: Prompts retelling to deepen understanding and memory of Maya achievements.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments video into 15 minutes, the Maya narrative into 2 minutes, and other activities into 5-10 minutes for focus.
- **Hands-On**: Includes outdoor shadow observation and coloring to engage kinesthetic learners with historical concepts.
- **Support for Natural Curiosity**: Encourages exploration of Maya astronomy and beliefs through storytelling and observation.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Highlights the Maya’s own view of their calendar, fostering respect for indigenous perspectives.

### Learning Objectives
1. Explain the Maya calendar’s purpose in simple terms (e.g., “It helped them plant crops”). Explain that the calendar is expressed today in the Guipil of Patzún.
2. Observe and describe a shadow’s direction to understand Maya shadow-casting for timekeeping.
3. Retell elements of the video, including a cultural belief (e.g., celestial guidance).
4. Color a Maya calendar wheel to visualize its design.
5. Engage in a picture study of the Huipil of Patzún to understand how the Mayan calendar is incorporated into modern cultural expressions.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Video**: [¿Por qué el CALENDARIO MAYA es tan preciso? Tzolkin, Haab y la Cuenta Larga](https://youtu.be/GgptPdr7yFQ?si=AC9Zrxyb6Y81UsaR). Covers the Tzolkin and Haab calendars, what they were used for and how they were important to the Maya. Makes a short mention of how the Maya observed celestial bodies and the sun to track time (12:54-13:24). Tie this to the shadow observation activity.
- **Printable**: Simplified Maya calendar wheel (from [`units/unit2/resources/mayan_calendar.svg`](resources/mayan_calendar.svg); alternatively, download from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IaIx8p01.svg); print or hand-draw if no printer).
- **Picture Study Image**: An image of the Huipil of Patzún showing the Mayan calendar design. Choose an image from [search results for Huipil of Patzún calendario](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=huipil+of+patz%C3%BAn+calendario&iar=images). This image will illustrate how the Mayan calendar is incorporated into modern variations of the Huipil in Patzún, connecting historical concepts to contemporary cultural expressions.
- **Supplies**:
  - Crayons or colored pencils (household items or ~$2-$5).
  - A stick (e.g., twig or pencil, ~6-12 inches) for shadow-casting observation.
- **Outdoor Space**: Safe, sunny area (e.g., backyard) for shadow observation.
- **Optional Visuals**: Images of Maya structures (e.g., search “Chichen Itza shadow serpent” online; free printable resources).
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost or free household items; ebooks prioritized; printable drawable by hand; outdoor space assumed available locally.

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage curiosity and introduce Maya achievements.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 1: “We learned about the Maya. Today, we’ll see their amazing calendar!”
     - Say, “They used the sun and stars to know when to farm. Let’s find out how!”
     - Show the calendar printable from [`units/unit2/resources/mayan_calendar.svg`](../resources/mayan_calendar.svg) to spark interest.
2. **Main Activity (35 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the calendar through narrative and hands-on activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Video (15 minutes)**: Watch the video [¿Por qué el CALENDARIO MAYA es tan preciso? Tzolkin, Haab y la Cuenta Larga](https://youtu.be/GgptPdr7yFQ?si=AC9Zrxyb6Y81UsaR). Covers the Tzolkin and Haab calendars, what they were used for and how they were important to the Maya.
       - **Note**: The video mentions how the Maya observed celestial bodies and the sun to track time (12:54-13:24). Tie this to the shadow observation activity.
     - **Outdoor Shadow-Casting Observation (5 minutes)**: Go to a sunny spot with a stick. Say, “The Maya watched shadows to track time.” Plant the stick upright and observe its shadow. Ask, “Which way does it point? Is it long or short?” Discuss: “They used shadows to know when to plant.” (If no sun, use a lamp indoors.) Consider leaving a stone at the edge of a shadow and coming back to demonstrate that the location of the shadow is different at different times of day.
     - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Show the selected image of the Huipil of Patzún. Say, “Look at this for 2 minutes. Notice the patterns and colors.” After 2 minutes, cover the image and ask, “What did you see? What shapes or colors do you remember?” Then, uncover it and discuss: “This is a Huipil from Patzún. It has designs that show the Mayan calendar. How do you think they use this today?”
     - **Coloring (10 minutes)**: Provide the calendar wheel from [`units/unit2/resources/mayan_calendar.svg`](../resources/mayan_calendar.svg) and crayons. Say, “Color this Maya calendar to see how they counted days!” Note its circular design.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the Maya calendar or what you saw outside.”
     - Listen for details (e.g., planting, shadows, gods) and note a key idea (e.g., “The calendar helped them”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “Today we learned about the Maya calendar, including the Tzolkin and Haab, how they used shadows to track time, and saw their calendar designs in the modern Huipil of Patzún.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll explore their art and writing!”
     - Add a calendar drawing to the timeline’s Pre-Columbian section.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Listening to a living book excerpt about Maya life.
  - **Maya Narrative (2 minutes)**: Hearing the Maya’s view of their calendar.
  - **Outdoor Observation (5 minutes)**: Observing a shadow to connect to Maya timekeeping.
  - **Picture Study (5 minutes)**: Examining the Huipil of Patzún to understand its connection to the Mayan calendar.
  - **Coloring (8 minutes)**: Coloring a calendar wheel to visualize Maya design.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling/Narrative**: Check narration for calendar uses or beliefs (e.g., planting, gods) to assess understanding.
  - **Outdoor Observation**: Ask about shadow direction to gauge engagement.
  - **Picture Study**: Ask questions about the Huipil of Patzún to assess understanding of its connection to the Mayan calendar.
  - **Coloring**: Note creativity in wheel design to assess participation.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect wheel for the portfolio, evaluating connection to objectives informally (no rubric; based on effort and inclusion of Maya elements).

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate calendar uses and beliefs; draw shadow shapes; write additional text.
- **Struggling Learners**: Shorten narrative to 1 minute; pre-color wheel sections; provide extra support.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Move the stick during observation; act out planting.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images of Maya structures to inspire coloring.
