# Lesson Plan: Unit 2, Lesson 1 - Maya Achievements and Calendar

### Overview
This lesson introduces the Maya civilization’s achievements, particularly their calendar system, to a 7-year-old student in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala, as part of a 10-week homeschool curriculum. Through storytelling with a living book excerpt, a narrative from a Maya perspective, an outdoor shadow-casting observation, copywork, and coloring, the student explores the calendar’s cultural significance. Designed with Charlotte Mason-inspired methods—narration, short lessons, and hands-on activities—it integrates an indigenous viewpoint to balance historical narratives, enhancing cultural sensitivity and connecting to the student’s heritage near Antigua.

### Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Living Books**: Uses an excerpt from *The Corn Grows Ripe* or *The Bird Who Cleans the World and Other Mayan Fables* for narrative-driven learning, supplemented by a Maya perspective to reflect their own voice, avoiding simplified texts.
- **Narration**: Prompts retelling to deepen understanding and memory of Maya achievements.
- **Short Lessons**: Segments storytelling into 10 minutes, the Maya narrative into 2 minutes, and other activities into 5-10 minutes for focus.
- **Hands-On**: Includes outdoor shadow observation and coloring to engage kinesthetic learners with historical concepts.
- **Copywork**: Features a sentence from the living book to connect handwriting practice with cultural content.
- **Support for Natural Curiosity**: Encourages exploration of Maya astronomy and beliefs through storytelling and observation.
- **Exposure to Diverse Cultures**: Highlights the Maya’s own view of their calendar, fostering respect for indigenous perspectives.

### Learning Objectives
1. Explain the Maya calendar’s purpose in simple terms (e.g., “It helped them plant crops”).
2. Observe and describe a shadow’s direction to understand Maya shadow-casting for timekeeping.
3. Retell elements of the living book story and the Maya narrative, including a cultural belief (e.g., celestial guidance).
4. Complete a copywork sentence to practice handwriting and reinforce Maya culture.
5. Color a Maya calendar wheel to visualize its design.

### Materials and Resources Required
- **Living Book Excerpt**: A 5-10 minute passage from *The Corn Grows Ripe* by Dorothy Rhoads (English, ebook on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Corn-Grows-Ripe-Dorothy-Rhoads-ebook/dp/B00B0S4K3G), ~$7) or *The Bird Who Cleans the World and Other Mayan Fables* by Victor Montejo (Spanish/English, ebook on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Who-Cleans-World-Fables-ebook/dp/B00B9I2G8E), ~$9)). Sourcing details in `overview/parent_guide.md`.

- **Supplies**:
  - Crayons or colored pencils (household items or ~$2-$5).
  - Plain paper or notebook for copywork (household item).
  - A stick (e.g., twig or pencil, ~6-12 inches) for shadow-casting observation.
- **Outdoor Space**: Safe, sunny area (e.g., backyard) for shadow observation.

- **Accessibility**: Low-cost or free household items; ebooks prioritized; printable drawable by hand; outdoor space assumed available locally.

### Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Engage curiosity and introduce Maya achievements.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Recap Unit 1: “We learned about the Maya. Today, we’ll see their amazing calendar!”
     - Say, “They used the sun and stars to know when to farm. Let’s find out how!”
     - Show the calendar printable to spark interest.
2. **Main Activity (30 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Explore the calendar through narrative and hands-on activities.
   - **Procedure**:
     - **Storytelling from Living Book (10 minutes)**: Read a 5-10 minute excerpt from *The Corn Grows Ripe* (e.g., farming life) or *The Bird Who Cleans the World* (e.g., a nature fable). Ask, “Why was the calendar important?” (Expect “For planting”).
     - **Maya Perspective Narrative (2 minutes)**: Say, “The Maya believed their calendar was a gift from the gods. It told them when to plant crops and celebrate. They thought the sun and stars were messages from the gods, guiding their lives.” Ask, “What do you think the stars told them?”
     - **Outdoor Shadow-Casting Observation (5 minutes)**: Go to a sunny spot with a stick. Say, “The Maya watched shadows to track time.” Plant the stick upright and observe its shadow. Ask, “Which way does it point? Is it long or short?” Discuss: “They used shadows to know when to plant.” (If no sun, use a lamp indoors.)
     - **Copywork (5 minutes)**: Provide paper or notebook with “The Maya loved corn.” (English) or “Los Mayas amaban el maíz.” (Spanish). Say, “Copy this to practice writing and remember the Maya.” Guide writing once or twice.
     - **Coloring (8 minutes)**: Provide the calendar wheel and crayons. Say, “Color this Maya calendar to see how they counted days!” Note its circular design.
3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Reinforce learning through retelling.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Prompt, “Tell me about the Maya calendar or what you saw outside.”
     - Listen for details (e.g., planting, shadows, gods) and note a key idea (e.g., “The calendar helped them”) for the portfolio.
4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - **Objective**: Summarize and preview next lesson.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Say, “The Maya’s calendar was special—it came from their gods and helped them live.”
     - Preview, “Next, we’ll explore their art and writing!”
     - Add a calendar drawing to the timeline’s Pre-Columbian section.

### Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Storytelling (10 minutes)**: Listening to a living book excerpt about Maya life.
  - **Maya Narrative (2 minutes)**: Hearing the Maya’s view of their calendar.
  - **Outdoor Observation (5 minutes)**: Observing a shadow to connect to Maya timekeeping.
  - **Copywork (5 minutes)**: Writing a sentence to reinforce cultural learning.
  - **Coloring (8 minutes)**: Coloring a calendar wheel to visualize Maya design.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - **Storytelling/Narrative**: Check narration for calendar uses or beliefs (e.g., planting, gods) to assess understanding.
  - **Outdoor Observation**: Ask about shadow direction to gauge engagement.
  - **Copywork**: Verify spelling and neatness (e.g., “corn” or “maíz” correct).
  - **Coloring**: Note creativity in wheel design to assess participation.
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Collect copywork and wheel for the portfolio, evaluating connection to objectives informally (no rubric; based on effort and inclusion of Maya elements).
  - In Week 10, review timeline for Unit 2 connection.

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Narrate calendar uses and beliefs; draw shadow shapes; write copywork twice.
- **Struggling Learners**: Shorten narrative to 1 minute; pre-color wheel sections; trace copywork.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Move the stick during observation; act out planting.
- **Visual Learners**: Use images of Maya structures to inspire coloring.

### Time Estimates
- Introduction: 5 minutes
- Main Activity: 30 minutes (10 min storytelling, 2 min narrative, 5 min observation, 5 min copywork, 8 min coloring)
