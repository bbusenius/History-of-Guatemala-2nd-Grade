# Maya Achievements Story

## Overview
This resource guides parents in sourcing or creating a story about Maya achievements, particularly their calendar system, for Unit 2, Lesson 1: Maya Achievements and Calendar. The story introduces the student to the Maya’s advanced understanding of time and astronomy, fostering appreciation for their ingenuity. It supports the lesson’s storytelling activity and aligns with Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on living stories.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not Common Core State Standards. The resource supports educational goals by:
- Introducing historical achievements through narrative.
- Encouraging narration skills as the student retells the story.
- Integrating language development with bilingual options.

## Learning Objectives
By using this resource, the student will be able to:
1. Recognize the Maya’s calendar as a key achievement.
2. Retell elements of the story during narration.
3. Connect the story to Maya culture and history.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Book or Story**: A children’s book or online story about the Maya calendar or achievements.

- **Optional**: Images of Maya calendars or artifacts (printable online).
- **Accessibility**: Libraries or internet access required.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Obtain the Story (Pre-Lesson)**:

3. **Use in Lesson 1 (15 Minutes)**:
   - Read the story aloud, showing images if available.
   - Discuss briefly (e.g., “Why was the calendar important to the Maya?”).

## Simplified Narrative (Optional)
If unable to find a story, use this simplified version:
“Long ago, the Maya people looked at the stars and sun to understand time. They made a special calendar to know when to plant crops and have festivals. Their calendar was like a big circle, and it helped them live in harmony with nature. The Maya were very smart to figure this out!”

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Read the story during Lesson 1 (15 minutes).
- **Formative Assessment**: During narration, ask the student to retell the story or explain why the calendar was important.
- **Summative Assessment**: Portfolio inclusion of narration notes or drawings related to the story.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**: Encourage adding details or researching more about the calendar.
- **Struggling Learners**: Use the simplified narrative and focus on key points.

## Time Estimates
- Sourcing: Variable.
- Preparation: 5 minutes.
- Reading: 15 minutes.

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening skills; familiarity with the Maya from Unit 1.
