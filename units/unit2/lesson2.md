# Unit 2, Lesson 2: Maya Art and Writing

## Overview
This lesson dives into the Maya’s unique art and writing, focusing on their glyph system and codices—folded books that preserved their stories and knowledge. Your 7-year-old will create a mini codex, making learning interactive and fun. Following Charlotte Mason’s approach, the lesson blends creativity with historical discovery.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This lesson meets homeschool goals and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, prioritizing hands-on activities and narration over Common Core. It supports:
- Art and history integration through crafting.
- Creative expression and fine motor development.
- Oral storytelling skills.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, the student will:
1. Understand that the Maya wrote with glyphs and used codices.
2. Make a mini codex with drawings or simple glyphs.
3. Describe their codex during narration.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Paper**: One sheet (standard or craft).
- **Markers or Crayons**: For drawing.
- **Craft Guide**: Instructions from [maya_codex_craft.md](resources/maya_codex_craft.md).
- **Optional**: Images of Maya glyphs (online or books).
- **Picture Study Image**: Image of the Madrid Codex from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Facs%C3%ADmil_C%C3%B3dice_Tro-Cortesiano.JPG) to show an actual example of a Maya codex.
- **Living Book**: 
  - *The Corn Grows Ripe* by Dorothy Rhoads (English, ebook on [Amazon](https://a.co/d/9PqSbaT), ~$7, or [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6203478M/The_corn_grows_ripe.), free with account). **Read Chapter 2**: *The Milpa*, focusing on Tigre’s discovery of an old temple and a figure. Discuss if this could have been a codex.
- **Copywork Paragraph** (written on paper or in a notebook — Can be 1 sentence or the whole paragraph depending on the student):
  - **English**: Tigre sat down by one of the half-buried stones and began to scrape away the dirt with his knife. A warm rich red began to show beneath the dirt and then, as he scraped, the figure of an animal appeared. A jaguar!
  - **Spanish**: Tigre se sentó junto a una de las piedras medio enterradas y comenzó a raspar la tierra con su cuchillo. Un rojo cálido y profundo empezó a aparecer bajo la tierra y luego, mientras raspaba, surgió la figura de un animal. ¡Un jaguar!

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - Say: "The Maya wrote with picture symbols called glyphs and made books called codices."
   - Show glyph images if available.

2. **Picture Study (5 minutes)**:
   - Show the image of the Madrid Codex from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Facs%C3%ADmil_C%C3%B3dice_Tro-Cortesiano.JPG).
   - Say: "Look at this for 2 minutes. Notice the pictures and lines. This is a real Maya book called a codex."
   - After 2 minutes, cover the image and ask: "What did you see? Were there animals or people?"
   - Then uncover it and discuss: "This is the Madrid Codex, one of the few surviving Maya books. It was produced in Yucatan, Mexico, and shows their stories with glyphs."

3. **Reading from Living Book (10 minutes)**:
   - **Read Chapter 2**: *The Milpa* from *The Corn Grows Ripe* by Dorothy Rhoads.
   - Focus on the part where Tigre sees an old temple and partially digs up a figure. Ask: "What did Tigre find? Could this figure have been part of a codex or another Maya artifact with writing on it?"
   - Tie this to the lesson by saying: "The Maya left behind many objects with their art and writing, like codices, which tell us about their lives."

4. **Copywork (5 minutes)**:
   - Provide the copywork paragraph from *The Corn Grows Ripe* (in English or Spanish, depending on the student’s preference).
   - Say: "Write this paragraph about Tigre finding a jaguar figure. It helps us remember the Maya artifacts."
   - Allow the student to write 1 sentence or the whole paragraph based on their skill level.

5. **Craft Activity (15 minutes)**:
   - Fold the paper accordion-style into 4-6 panels.
   - Draw Maya-inspired scenes (e.g., jaguars, stars) or simple glyphs on each panel.
   - Encourage a short story: "What could your codex be about?"
   - Pull up images of codices and glyphs to show the student while he or she works.

6. **Narration (5 minutes)**:
   - Ask: "What does your codex show?" or "Tell me your story."
   - Listen for connections to Maya writing or creativity.

7. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - Recap: "The Maya used glyphs and codices to share their ideas."
   - Preview: "Next, we’ll take a field trip to the [Iximché ruins](field_trip.md)"
   - **Update timeline**: Add a codex or artifact sketch to the timeline’s Pre-Columbian section with the student.

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activities**:
  - **Picture Study**: Observing the Madrid Codex to understand Maya writing.
  - **Reading**: Listening to Chapter 2 of *The Corn Grows Ripe* and discussing Tigre’s discovery.
  - **Crafting**: Creating a mini codex.
  - **Copywork**: Writing a paragraph from *The Corn Grows Ripe* to practice handwriting and connect to the story.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe effort in craft; check narration for glyph/codex mention; assess picture study responses for engagement with the Madrid Codex image; note connections made during the reading discussion about Tigre’s find.
- **Summative Assessment**: Keep the codex for the portfolio.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced**: Add more panels or detailed drawings.
- **Struggling**: Pre-fold paper; focus on one drawing.
