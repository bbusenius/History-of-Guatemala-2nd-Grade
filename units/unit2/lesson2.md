# Unit 2, Lesson 2: Maya Art and Writing

## Overview
This lesson dives into the Maya’s unique art and writing, focusing on their glyph system and codices—folded books that preserved their stories and knowledge. Your 7-year-old will create a mini codex, making learning interactive and fun. Following Charlotte Mason’s approach, the lesson blends creativity with historical discovery.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This lesson meets homeschool goals and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, prioritizing hands-on activities and narration over Common Core. It supports:
- Art and history integration through crafting.
- Creative expression and fine motor development.
- Oral storytelling skills.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, the student will:
1. Understand that the Maya wrote with glyphs and used codices.
2. Make a mini codex with drawings or simple glyphs.
3. Describe their codex during narration.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Paper**: One sheet (standard or craft).
- **Markers or Crayons**: For drawing.
- **Craft Guide**: Instructions from `units/unit2/resources/maya_codex_craft.md`.
- **Optional**: Images of Maya glyphs (online or books).

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**:
   - Say: "The Maya wrote with picture symbols called glyphs and made books called codices."
   - Show glyph images if available.

2. **Craft Activity (25 minutes)**:
   - Fold the paper accordion-style into 4-6 panels.
   - Draw Maya-inspired scenes (e.g., jaguars, stars) or simple glyphs on each panel.
   - Encourage a short story: "What could your codex be about?"

3. **Narration (10 minutes)**:
   - Ask: "What does your codex show?" or "Tell me your story."
   - Listen for connections to Maya writing or creativity.

4. **Closing (5 minutes)**:
   - Recap: "The Maya used glyphs and codices to share their ideas."
   - Preview: "Next, we’ll visit Iximché ruins!"

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Crafting a mini codex.
- **Formative Assessment**: Observe effort; check narration for glyph/codex mention.
- **Summative Assessment**: Keep the codex for the portfolio.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced**: Add more panels or detailed drawings.
- **Struggling**: Pre-fold paper; focus on one drawing.

## Time Estimates
- Total: 45 minutes (Introduction: 5, Craft: 25, Narration: 10, Closing: 5).

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- Basic drawing skills; Unit 1 Maya intro.

## Parental Involvement
- Help fold paper, guide drawing, and prompt narration.

## Accommodations
- Pre-fold for motor difficulties; use large paper for visibility.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes basic supplies; pencils work if markers are unavailable.
