# Portfolio Checklist for Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum

## Overview
This portfolio checklist is designed to track a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student’s progress through the 10-week Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum. It organizes lesson outputs—such as crafts, maps, narrations, and timeline additions—into a cohesive record of learning, suitable for a homeschool setting in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. Aligned with Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, the portfolio emphasizes informal assessment through tangible evidence of engagement, creativity, and comprehension, avoiding formal grading. The checklist requires minimal preparation and is flexible, allowing parents to store outputs physically (e.g., binder) or digitally (e.g., folder, app like Seesaw). It supports the curriculum’s culminating timeline presentation in Week 10 and fosters cultural appreciation by documenting the student’s connection to Guatemalan history.

## Alignment with Educational Standards
This curriculum adheres to homeschool requirements and Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, not following Common Core State Standards as specified in the course rules. The portfolio checklist supports educational goals by:
- Providing a structured way to collect evidence of historical and cultural learning, aligning with homeschool objectives.
- Supporting informal assessment through creative outputs, suitable for a young learner’s developmental stage.
- Encouraging parental involvement in tracking progress, a Charlotte Mason emphasis on co-learning.
- Reinforcing cross-curricular skills (e.g., art via crafts, geography via maps) through documented work.

## Learning Objectives
By using this portfolio checklist, the student and parent will be able to:
1. Compile a complete set of lesson outputs (e.g., crafts, narrations) to demonstrate engagement with Guatemalan history.
2. Track contributions to the visual timeline, culminating in the Week 10 final project presentation.
3. Reflect on learning through portfolio review, fostering pride in cultural and historical understanding.

3. **Mark Completion (2-3 minutes per lesson)**:
   - Check the box next to each collected output on the checklist.
   - Add brief notes (e.g., “Loved drawing the quetzal!”) to capture engagement or insights.
4. **Review and Reflect (10-15 minutes, Week 10)**:
   - Before the final project, review the portfolio with the student, discussing favorite outputs (e.g., “Remember when we made the mask?”).

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: Collect outputs after each lesson and field trip (5 minutes per lesson), checking them off and adding notes on the checklist.
- **Formative Assessment**:
  - Monitor completion of outputs during lessons (e.g., is the map colored correctly?).
  - Note engagement via checklist comments (e.g., “Very excited about mask craft”).
- **Summative Assessment**:
  - Review the completed portfolio in Week 10 to assess participation and creativity across units.
  - Evaluate the final timeline presentation for recall and enthusiasm, using portfolio outputs as evidence of learning (no formal rubric; based on effort).

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
  - Include extra outputs (e.g., written narrations) or detailed notes in the checklist.
  - Encourage organizing the portfolio with labels or sections.
- **Struggling Learners**:
  - Reduce expected outputs (e.g., one narration per unit instead of per lesson).
  - Accept simpler outputs (e.g., a photo of a craft instead of the physical item).
- **Visual Learners**:
  - Emphasize drawings or photos in the portfolio; use colorful dividers in the binder.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Involve the student in physically organizing the portfolio (e.g., hole-punching papers).

## Time Estimates
- Setup: 10-15 minutes (before Week 1)
- Collecting Outputs: 5 minutes per lesson (40 lessons total)
- Marking Completion: 2-3 minutes per lesson
- Review and Reflect: 10-15 minutes (Week 10)
- Total per Lesson: ~7-8 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Ability to produce outputs (e.g., draw, craft) as guided in lessons; no additional skills needed.
- **Parent**: Basic organization skills to store outputs; ability to write brief notes.

## Parental Involvement
- **Setup**: Prepare the portfolio storage before Week 1 and print/access the checklist.
- **Facilitation**: Collect and store outputs after each lesson, marking the checklist.
- **Engagement**: Discuss outputs with the student (e.g., “This mask is so colorful!”).
- **Follow-Up**: Review the portfolio in Week 10 to prepare for the final presentation.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use large-print checklist; describe outputs aloud when reviewing.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with storing outputs or use digital photos instead of physical items.
- **Attention Span**: Break collection into short tasks (e.g., store one output at a time).
- **Language Support**: Add bilingual notes (e.g., “mapa/map”) in the checklist for clarity.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes access to storage (binder or device); if unavailable, use a box or free app like Google Drive.
- Assumes lessons produce the listed outputs; if a lesson is skipped, adjust the checklist accordingly.
- Digital storage requires basic tech access; physical storage is sufficient if tech is unavailable.
