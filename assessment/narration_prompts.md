# Narration Prompts for Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum

## Overview
This document provides narration prompts for each of the 10 units in the Guatemala History Homeschool Curriculum, designed for a 7-year-old 2nd-grade student living in San Juan del Obispo, Guatemala. Narration, a cornerstone of Charlotte Mason’s philosophy, encourages students to process and express what they’ve learned in their own words, fostering comprehension, memory, and oral language development. These prompts are tailored to the curriculum’s chronological exploration of Guatemalan history—from the Maya civilization to modern times—and its cultural elements, with a focus on the student’s local context. They are used during the narration segment of each lesson (10 minutes) to assess understanding informally, requiring minimal preparation. The prompts evolve in complexity across units to support skill progression: simple retellings in Units 1-3, descriptive responses in Units 4-7, and comparative reflections in Units 8-10, aligning with Charlotte Mason’s developmental approach.

## Alignment with Charlotte Mason Guidelines
- **Narration**: Prompts encourage students to retell lesson content naturally, building comprehension without interruption, as Charlotte Mason advocated.
- **Support Progression**: Designed to advance from basic recall (e.g., “What happened?”) to descriptive details (e.g., “What did it look like?”) and comparative thinking (e.g., “How is this different?”), reflecting Charlotte Mason’s emphasis on gradual skill development.
- **Living Stories**: Paired with narrative-driven lessons, prompts deepen engagement with historical and cultural content.
- **Natural Curiosity**: Open-ended questions spark independent thought and personal connection to the material.

## Learning Objectives
By using these narration prompts, the student will be able to:
1. Retell key details from each lesson about Guatemalan history or culture in simple sentences, progressing to more detailed descriptions.
2. Connect lesson content to personal or local contexts (e.g., San Juan del Obispo) through reflective responses.
3. Demonstrate engagement and comprehension through oral narration, advancing to comparative reflections by Unit 10.

## Materials and Resources Required
- **Notebook or Paper**: For parents to jot down key narration points (optional; household item).
- **Optional**: Sketchbook or drawing supplies (crayons, markers; ~$2-$5) for students to draw responses instead of speaking, supporting visual learners.
- **Optional**: Audio recorder (e.g., smartphone) to capture narrations for the portfolio, aiding auditory learners and documentation.
- **Parent Guide**: Reference `overview/parent_guide.md` for tips on prompting narration (provided in curriculum).
- **Accessibility**: No additional cost; household items suffice; prompts can be used verbally without materials, ensuring inclusivity.

## Step-by-Step Instructional Procedures
1. **Preparation (2-5 minutes, before lesson)**:
 - Review the unit’s prompts (listed below) and select one or two that match the lesson’s focus (e.g., Maya daily life for Unit 1, Lesson 2).
 - Ensure a quiet space to help the student focus during narration.
 - Gather optional materials (notebook, sketchbook) if recording or drawing responses.
2. **Facilitate Narration (10 minutes, during lesson)**:
 - At the lesson’s narration segment, ask the chosen prompt (e.g., “What happened in the story of the quetzal?”).
 - Encourage the student to respond in their own words, starting with simple sentences in Units 1-3 (e.g., “The quetzal flew”), progressing to descriptive details in Units 4-7 (e.g., “The buildings were tall and yellow”), and comparative reflections in Units 8-10 (e.g., “It’s different now because we have cars”).
 - If needed, rephrase or provide a hint (e.g., “What did the Maya eat?”) to guide without leading.
 - Praise efforts (e.g., “I love how you remembered that!”) and avoid correcting details to build confidence.
3. **Record or Collect (2-3 minutes, during lesson)**:
 - Jot down a key sentence from the narration (e.g., “The Spanish built a church”) for the portfolio.
 - Alternatively, let the student draw a picture of their response (e.g., a church) or record the narration using a smartphone.
 - Store outputs in a binder or digital folder per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
4. **Follow-Up (Optional, 2-3 minutes, post-lesson)**:
 - Discuss the narration briefly (e.g., “That’s a great detail about the festival!”) to reinforce learning.
 - Add a related item to the timeline (e.g., a kite drawing) as prompted in the lesson plan.

## Narration Prompts by Unit
Below are prompts for each unit, designed to progress in complexity:
- **Units 1-3: Simple Retelling** - Focus on basic recall of events or facts to build foundational narration skills.
- **Units 4-7: Descriptive** - Encourage detailed observations of settings, objects, or emotions to enhance expressive language.
- **Units 8-10: Comparative** - Prompt reflection on differences or changes over time to develop critical thinking.

**Unit 1: Introduction to Guatemala and the Maya Civilization**
- What happened in the story of the quetzal?
- Where is Guatemala on the map?

**Unit 2: Maya Civilization - Daily Life and Achievements**
- What did a Maya child do every day?
- What’s something the Maya built or created?

**Unit 3: The Colonial Period - Spanish Arrival and Impact**
- What did the Spanish do when they arrived in Guatemala?
- How did life change for people during colonial times?

**Unit 4: Colonial Life in Antigua**
- What did the buildings in Antigua look like during colonial times?
- What kind of jobs did people have in colonial Antigua?

**Unit 5: Independence of Guatemala**

## Activities and Assessments
- **Activity**: During each lesson’s narration segment (10 minutes), the student responds to one or two selected prompts, retelling lesson content verbally or through drawings.
- **Formative Assessment**:
 - Listen for key details in the narration (e.g., mentions electricity in Unit 6) to gauge comprehension and progression in complexity.
 - Observe engagement (e.g., enthusiasm, detail level) during retelling or drawing, noting improvement from simple to descriptive to comparative responses.
- **Summative Assessment**:
 - Collect narration outputs (notes, drawings, or recordings) for the portfolio, assessing participation and recall informally per `assessment/portfolio_checklist.md`.
 - In Week 10, evaluate the student’s ability to narrate favorite historical moments during the final project presentation, focusing on creativity and connection to lessons without formal grading.

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced Learners**:
 - Ask follow-up questions to deepen responses (e.g., “Why do you think the quetzal was important?” for Unit 1).
 - Encourage a short written narration (1-2 sentences) alongside verbal retelling for Units 8-10 to stretch skills.
- **Struggling Learners**:
 - Simplify prompts further (e.g., “What’s one thing from the story?”) for Units 1-3; provide visual cues (e.g., point to map) to aid recall.
 - Allow drawing or pointing to visuals (e.g., timeline) instead of speaking for early units.
- **Auditory Learners**:
 - Emphasize verbal retelling with expressive prompts; record responses for playback to reinforce learning.
- **Visual Learners**:
 - Pair prompts with images (e.g., quetzal picture for Unit 1, church photo for Unit 8) to spark ideas and support memory.

## Time Estimates
- Preparation: 2-5 minutes (review prompts)
- Narration Activity: 10 minutes (per lesson)
- Recording/Collecting: 2-3 minutes
- Follow-Up (Optional): 2-3 minutes
- Total per Lesson: ~15 minutes

## Prerequisite Knowledge or Skills
- **Student**: Basic listening and speaking skills (e.g., can respond to simple questions); familiarity with the lesson’s topic from prior activities (provided within each lesson).
- **Parent**: Ability to ask questions and listen actively; no specialized skills needed, as prompts guide facilitation.

## Parental Involvement
- **Preparation**: Select prompts before the lesson and gather optional materials (e.g., notebook).
- **Facilitation**: Ask the prompt, listen to the response, and encourage the student with positive feedback (e.g., “That’s a great story!”).
- **Engagement**: Co-learn by discussing responses (e.g., “I liked hearing about the Maya too!”).
- **Follow-Up**: Store outputs in the portfolio and add timeline items as directed in lessons.

## Accommodations
- **Visual Needs**: Use images or props (e.g., quetzal feather) to support prompts; describe visuals aloud if needed (e.g., “The map shows Guatemala here”).
- **Auditory Needs**: Speak clearly and repeat prompts slowly; allow written or drawn responses if verbalizing is challenging.
- **Motor Challenges**: Assist with drawing or writing if used; accept verbal-only narration for simplicity.
- **Attention Span**: Use one short prompt or break narration into two 5-minute segments with a pause.
- **Language Support**: Offer prompts in English and Spanish (e.g., “¿Qué pasó en la historia del quetzal?” for Unit 1) for bilingual reinforcement; allow responses in the preferred language.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes the student can speak or draw to express ideas; non-verbal students may need alternative methods (e.g., pointing to pictures).
- Assumes parents can facilitate discussions; if challenging, simplify prompts or pair with visuals (e.g., show a church photo for Unit 8).
- Relies on lesson content for context; prompts are ineffective without prior lesson activities, requiring completion of each unit’s lessons first.
